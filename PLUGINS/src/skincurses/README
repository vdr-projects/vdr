Description:

The 'skincurses' plugin implements a VDR skin that works in a
shell window, using only plain text output. It re-implements
what used to be available by compiling VDR versions before 1.3.7
with the DEBUG_OSD macro set.

To activate this skin you can either select it in the Setup/OSD
menu, or put the line

OSDSkin = curses

into your 'setup.conf' file before starting VDR. Make sure this
is the only OSDSkin line in that file.
