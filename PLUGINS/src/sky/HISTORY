2006-12-02: Version 0.3.5 (version number not increased)

- Made the getskyepg.pl script send a user agent message to
  the server, according to the rules at http://bleb.org/tv/data/listings.
  If your version of 'wget' doesn't support the -U option to set the user agent,
  use the new option -U of getskyepg.pl to have the information added to the URL
  as a query string.
- The getskyepg.pl script now replaces "&amp;" with "&".

2007-08-15:Version 0.3.6

- Moved the "all" target in the Makefile before the "Implicit rules",
  so that a plain "make" will compile everything.

2008-03-22:Version 0.3.7

- Removed the full path from the 'logger' call in the getskyepg.pl script (this
  program is apparently "on the move" through the file system...).
