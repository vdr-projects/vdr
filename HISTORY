Video Disk Recorder Revision History
------------------------------------

2000-02-19: Version 0.01

- Initial revision.

2000-03-11: Version 0.02

- Fixed compilation with only DEBUG_REMOTE=1.
- Menus now use colors.
- Support for "Red", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue" buttons.
- Channels and Timers can now be added, deleted and moved.
- Basic record/play file handling support (no actual record/playback yet).

2000-04-15: Version 0.03

- Actual record/replay now works.
- Dropped the idea of different "recording qualities" (a 36GB harddisk is
  able to store some 18 hours in full quality, so we don't really need that).
- Termination signals are now caught and the program cleans up before exiting.
- Support for CICAM.

2000-04-24: Version 0.04

- Changed name from 'osm' to 'vdr' to avoid mixups with the 'oms' program that
  appears to be in use with DVD replay.
- Implemented a channel display in the top menu line.
- Implemented replay progress display (press "Ok" when replaying to bring it up).
- Implemented direct channel selecting by pressing the numeric keys.
- Added several 'const' keywords to please stricter compilers.
- The repeat function for the remote control no longer adapts dynamically
  to the timing of the RCU (this sometimes caused the repeat function to
  kick in too early).
- Channel selection is now blocked when recording or replaying.
- Improved process handling.

2000-05-27: Version 0.05

- Support for more than one DVB card.
- Simultaneous record and replay (with two DVB cards).
- Instant recordings no longer get the name "instant". They now get the name
  of the channel, with a prepended '@' character.
- Timers that are not given an explicit Name now use the channel name with
  a prepended '@' character.
- If an instant recording is currently active, the "Main" menu now contains
  an option to stop that recording.
- Timers are now only processed when the menu is not active. So after editing
  a timer the effect will take place only after the menu has been closed.
  In order to avoid missing a timer event by inadvertently leaving the menu
  open, the menu will be closed automatically after about two minutes of
  inactivity.
- If a recording is currently being replayed, the "Main" menu now contains an
  option to stop replaying.
- Displaying the recording DVB interface status in the decimal points of the
  RCU display.
- Reduced the number of remote control keys. Modified the key assignments for
  the PC keyboard to better resemble the "up-down-left-right-ok" layout on
  menu controlling remote control units.

2000-07-25: Version 0.6

- Added support for LIRC remote control (thanks to Carsten Koch!).
  There are now three different remote control modes: KBD (PC-Keyboard), RCU
  and LIRC. See the INSTALL file for information on how to enable either of
  these modes. The default mode is now KBD, not RCU as before (to make it
  work immediately even if there is no actual remote control).
- Fixed small bug in dvbapi.c that was causing some channels (many on hotbird)
  not to be correctly tuned (thanks to Plamen Ganev!).
- Now clearing the replay buffer in search forward/back, which results in
  faster reaction.
- The 'Recordings' menu is now listed alphabetically (thanks to Carsten Koch!).
- The new 'epg2timers' tool (thanks to Carsten Koch!) can be used to convert
  an EPG "merkliste" page (http://www.tvtv.de) to vdr timer entries.
- The new 'xtvrc2vdr' tool (thanks to Plamen Ganev!) can be used to convert
  'xtvrc' channel files into 'vdr' format.
- When more than one timer matches at the same time, the first one in the list
  with the highest 'Priority' is selected.
- The MANUAL section on "Programming the Timer" has been filled in.
- The year in the "Recordings" menu as well as in the progress display during
  replay has been reduced to 2 digits to allow more space for the recording's
  title. In the internal file structure the year is still stored with 4 digits,
  so there will be no problem at the next turn of the century ;-)
- Channel names and timer filenames can now contain blanks. To avoid problems
  with file names that contain blanks, all blanks in recording file names are
  converted to underscores.
- The polarization can now be given in uppercase or lowercase characters in
  'channels.conf'.
- Fixed buffer initialization to work with DVB driver version 0.6.
- Implemented the "Simple Video Disk Recorder Protocol" (SVDRP) to control
  the VDR over a network connection.
- Implemented command line option handling.
- The program can now run in full background mode by using the --daemon option.
- Added a "summary" field to the timers (thanks to Carsten Koch!).
  This field can contain a descriptive text of the programme and will be
  displayed when the "Blue" button is pressed on a recording that was created by
  this timer. If the text contains the special character '|', a newline will
  be inserted at that place.  When pressing "Ok" on a timer that contains a
  summary field, the summary will be displayed. To edit such a timer the "Red"
  key must be pressed. Timers without a summary still go into Edit mode when
  pressing "Ok".  The summary field can only be filled in directly by editing
  the 'timers.conf' file with a text editor, or by defining/modifying the timer
  via the SVDRP interface.

2000-08-06: Version 0.61

- When scrolling through a list it now moves a full page up or down when the
  cursor reaches the top or bottom of the menu (thanks to Heino Goldenstein!).
- Added missing '#include <sys/stat.h>' to recording.c.
- The video directory can now be defined with the command line option -v.
- There can now be more than one video directory (in case you have several
  disks).
- Fixed learning key codes for PC keyboard.
- New command line option '-l' to set the log level.
- Times in timers.conf are now always printed with 4 digits (leading '0').
- Slow forward/back mode (thanks to Guido Fiala!).
- The "Up" key in replay mode no longer restarts replay at the very beginning,
  but rather resumes normal replay mode after a "pause", "forward" or "backward"
  operation. Use the "Skip -60s" function repeatedly to go back to the beginning
  of the recording.
- Improved reaction on user input in fast/slow forward/back modes.
- No more upper limit for the value of 'Pnr'.
- Checking if the video card is really a DVB card.
- New SVDRP command UPDT to update an existing timer (or add a new one if it
  doesn't yet exist).
- New version of the 'epg2timers' tool (with a modified channel list).
- Bugfix in closing window in DEBUG_OSD mode.

2000-09-03: Version 0.62

- The Makefile now defines DVBDIR to easily point to where the DVB driver
  source is located.
- When switching channels the current/next information is now displayed if
  available (thanks to Robert Schneider). Since there is now more information
  to read when switching channels, the timeout for displaying it has been
  increased from 2 to 5 seconds (remember that this info can always be recalled
  by pressing the "Ok" button).
  For this feature to work it is necessary that the 'Pnr' parameter in the
  channel setup ('channels.conf') is set to the proper value. This has been
  done for some of the channels in the default 'channels.conf'. Some other
  parameters in the default 'channels.conf' have also been updated, so please
  make sure your timers still use the correct channels!

2000-09-10: Version 0.63

- The new "Setup" menu allows the user to configure several parameters to his/her
  personal taste (see MANUAL for details).
- Workaround for a driver timing problem in cDvbApi::Cmd(), which sometimes caused
  the OSD to no longer be displayed (thanks to Niels de Carpentier).
- Added the '-m486' option to the compiler call.
- If a channel name contains a colon (':') it is now replaced with a '|' in
  'channels.conf'.
- Not everybody appears to like the "page scrolling" mechanism introduced by
  Heino Goldenstein in version 0.61, so this is now configurable via the "Setup"
  menu.
- The new 'dvbrc2vdr' tool (thanks to Plamen Ganev!) can be used to convert
  'dvbrc' channel files into 'vdr' format.
- Channels can now be "grouped" (thanks to Plamen Ganev!). See MANUAL for details.
  There is currently no mechanism to define and maintain "Channel groups" via
  the menu, so you'll have to insert "Channel group" control lines into your
  'channels.conf' file manually (for example with a text editor).
- Started a new file named FORMATS with a description of the various file
  formats used by VDR.
- The "Primary DVB interface" can now be chosen via the "Setup" menu.
- Display of the "current/next" information when switching channels can now
  be disabled via the "Setup" menu.
- The "current/next" display now only shows those lines that actually contain
  information.
- When directly selecting a channel by entering the channel number, the digits
  entered so far together with the name of that channel are displayed on the
  OSD (suggested by Martin Hammerschmid).

2000-09-20: Version 0.64

- NOTE: If you are using DVB driver version 0.7 you need to load the dvb.o
  module with option outstream=0, so your insmod statement should read
  'insmod dvb.o outstream=0'. This is currently necessary because 'vdr'
  still works with AV_PES data.
- Video files now have the 'group read' bit set.
- Fixed handling errors in 'readstring()'.
- Handling SIGPIPE and re-establishing handler after intercepting a signal.
- The configuration files are now by default read from the video directory.
  This can be changed by using the new '-c' option. Make sure you copy your
  current '*.conf' files to your video directory ('/video' by default), or
  use "-c ." to get the old behaviour of loading the configuration files
  from the current directory.
- Waiting for input is now handled by a common function, which improves
  response time on user actions. As a consequence the EIT data may sometimes
  not be displayed, but this will change later when cEIT runs as a separate
  thread.
- The new SVDRP command 'HITK' (thanks to Guido Fiala!) can be used to 'hit'
  a remote control key.  Establish an SVDRP connection and enter HITK without
  a parameter for a list of all valid key names.
- The new SVDRP command 'GRAB' (thanks to Guido Fiala!) can be used to grab
  the current frame and save it to a file.
- The new SVDRP commands 'OVL*' can be used to control video overlays (thanks
  to Guido Fiala!). This is mainly for use in the 'kvdr' tool (see the 'kvdr'
  page at http://www.s.netic.de/gfiala).
- If the name of the video directory used with the '-v' option had trailing
  slashes, the recording file names have been damaged. Trailing slashes are
  now silently removed.
- Fixed a buffer overflow in EIT parsing.
- Added a security warning regarding SVDRP to the INSTALL file.
- Fixed 'confirm' dialog.
- The daemon mode (option '-d') now no longer works with REMOTE=KBD (there
  is no stdin in daemon mode, so KBD makes no sense - plus it sometimes
  crashed).

2000-10-03: Version 0.65

- Modified LIRC interface to better handle repeat function.
- Faster OSD by first writing into a bitmap and then sending the entire bitmap
  to the DVB driver at once (requires the patch 'dvb.c.071.diff' to be applied
  against the version 0.71 DVB driver file 'dvb.c').
- When switching channels the channel is now immediately displayed, and the
  current/next information is shown as soon as it becomes available.
- No longer displaying the year in the 'Recordings' menu to save space for the
  title.
- The 'Recordings' menu now displays a '*' to indicate new recordings.
- Added the description of the timers.conf file to the FORMATS file (thanks to
  Bastian Guse).
- Displaying as much as possible of the current/next info (dropping characters
  that would display only partially).
- In normal viewing mode the '0' key now toggles between the current and the
  previous channel.

2000-10-08: Version 0.66

- Remote control data is now received in a separate thread, which makes things
  a lot smoother.
- Repeat and release of remote control keys is now explicitly distinguished.
- In replay mode the search forward/back and skip functions now have two modes:
  Pressing the key shortly and releasing it starts the function, and pressing it
  again stops it. Pressing and holding down the key starts the function and
  releasing the key stops it.
- The '@' character that marks an "instant recording" can now be turned off
  in the "Setup" menu (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- Pressing the "Back" button while replaying now stops replaying and brings up
  the "Recordings" menu (suggested by Carsten Koch). This can be used to easily
  delete a recording after watching it, or to switch to a different recording.
- The "Recordings" menu now places the cursor on the last replayed recording, if
  that file still exists.
- The "Blue" button in the "Main" menu can now be used to "Resume" a previously
  stopped replay session (suggested by Martin Hammerschmid).
- The low and high LNB frequencies can now be changed in the "Setup" menu.

2000-11-01: Version 0.67

- The EIT information is now gathered in a separate thread.
- The system time can now be synchronized to the time broadcast in the DVB data
  stream. This can be enabled in the "Setup" menu by setting "SetSystemTime" to
  1.  Note that this works only if VDR is running under a user ID that has
  permission to set the system time.
- The new item "Schedule" in the "Main" menu opens VDR's EPG (thanks to Robert
  Schneider). See the MANUAL file for a detailed description.
- The new setup parameters MarginStart and MarginStop define how long (in
  minutes) before the official start time of a broadcast VDR shall begin
  recording, and how long after the official end time it shall stop recording.
  These are used when a recording is programmed from the "Schedules" menu.
- The delay value in the dvb.c.071.diff patch to the driver has been increased
  to '3', because on some systems the OSD was not displayed correctly. If you
  are running an already patched version 0.71 driver and encounter problems
  with the OSD, please make sure the parameter in the ddelay call is '3', not
  '2'.
- Fixed initializing the RCU remote control code (didn't work after switching
  on the system).
- Problematic characters in recording names (which can come from timers that
  are programmed via the "Schedules" menu) are now replaced by suitable
  substitutes.

2000-11-19: Version 0.68

- Date and time in the title of an event info page are now always right adjusted.
- The 'current channel' is now handled device specific (in case there is more
  than one DVB card).
- The 'SetSystemTime' option in the "Setup" menu is now shown as "yes/no".
- Implemented "internationalization" (see 'i18n.c' for information on how to
  add new languages). Thanks to Miha Setina for translating the OSD texts to
  the Slovenian language.
- Fixed learning keys on the PC keyboard (display oscillated).
- Fixed a timing problem with OSD refresh and SVDRP.
- Avoiding multiple definitions of the same timer in the "Schedule" menu (this
  could happen when pressing the "Red" button while editing the timer).
- There can now be a configuration file named 'commands.conf' that defines
  commands that can be executed through the "Main" menu's "Commands" option
  (see FORMATS for details on how to define these commands).
- Added a 'fixed' font for use with the output of system commands.
- The 'Priority' parameter of the timers is now also used to interrupt a low
  priority timer recording if a higher priority timer wants to record.
- A timer recording on a DVB card with a CAM module will now be interrupted
  by a timer that needs to use this specific DVB card to record an encrypted
  channel, if the timer currently occupying this DVB card doesn't need the
  CAM module (and thus can continue recording on a different DVB card).
- The "Yellow" button in the "What's on now/next?" menus now displays the
  schedule of the current channel from that menu.
- All DVB cards in a multi-card system now write their EIT information into the
  same data structure.
- If there is more than one DVB card in the system, the non-primary cards are
  now used to periodically scan through the channels in order to keep the
  EPG info up-to-date. Scanning kicks in after 60 seconds of user inactivity
  (timeout in order to keep user interactions instantaneously) and each channel
  that has the 'pnr' parameter defined in 'channels.conf' is switched to for
  20 seconds. If there is only one DVB card in the system, that card will start
  scanning after 5 hours (configurable through the "Setup" menu) of user inactivity
  and will switch back to the channel it originally displayed at the first sign of
  user activity. Any scanning will only occur if that particular card is not
  currently recording or replaying.
- Now shifting the 'Subtitle' info into the 'ExtendedDescription' on stations
  that don't send the EIT information correctly (like, e.g., 'VOX').
- Implemented a 10 seconds latency when removing files.
- Fixed unwanted reaction on the "Green" and "Yellow" button in the "Event" display.
- Implemented 'Transfer Mode' to display video data from the DVB card that actually
  can receive a certain channel on the primary interface. This is currently in
  an early state and may still cause some problems, but it appears to work nice
  already.

2001-01-18: Version 0.70

- VDR now requires driver version 0.8.1 or higher.
- Recordings are now saved in PES mode. Note that you now need to install the
  driver *WITHOUT* 'outstream=0'! This is the default when you 'make insmod' in
  the DVB/driver directory.
  Old recordings (in AV_PES mode) can still be replayed (as long as the driver
  still supports replaying AV_PES files). The only limitation with this is that
  in fast forward/back mode the picture may be slightly distorted and there may
  be sound fragments.
- The EPG data is now dumped into the file /video/epg.data every ten minutes.
  Use the Perl script 'epg2html.pl' to convert the raw EPG data into a simple
  HTML programme listing.
- Fixed handling of channel switching with the "Blue" button in the "What's on
  now/next?" menus.
- Fixed saving the MarginStop setup parameter.
- Fixed missing initialization in cConfig.
- Implemented "On Disk Editing".
- There is no more default 'timers.conf' file.
- Added Italian language texts (thanks to Alberto Carraro).
- Fixed starting a replay session when the program is currently in 'Transfer
  Mode'.
- Fixed setting/modifying timers via SVDRP with empty summary fields.
- Fixed a problem with recordings that have a single quote character in their
  name (this is now mapped to 0x01).
- Changed the value for Diseqc to '0' in the default 'channels.conf'.
- Fixed displaying channels and recording status in the RCU's LED display when
  a recording is interrupted due to higher priority.
- Implemented safe writing of config files (first writes into a temporary file
  and then renames it).
- In case the video data stream is broken the log message will come only every
  5 seconds.
- The current channel is now saved in the 'setup.conf' file when VDR is canceled,
  and will be restored next time it is started (thanks to Deti Fliegl).
- The EIT scanning thread is now locked when switching channels to avoid problems.
- Encrypted channels can now be selected even without knowing the PNR (however, it
  is still necessary for the EPG info).

2001-02-24: Version 0.71

- Fixed 'Transfer Mode' in cases where a non-primary interface was switched to
  a channel that only the primary interface can receive (which could happen in
  the EPG scanner).
- The EPG scanner now starts with the first channel (it used to start with the
  second channel).
- Reactivated setting the PNR.
- Adapted the frame scanning to the new muxing of the driver.
- The new compile time option REMOTE=NONE can be used to compile VDR without
  any remote control support (for applications where it shall be controlled
  exclusively via SVDRP).
- The new command line option -D can be used to define which DVB interfaces
  a certain instance of VDR shall use.
- The "Left" and "Right" keys are now used to page up and down in lists (thanks
  to Martin Hammerschmid). Since the "Timers" menu already uses these keys to
  (de)activate timers, this functionality is not available there.
- The "Main" and "Commands" menu now support "hotkeys", which means that if the
  first non-blank character of a menu item is a digit in the range 1..9, that
  item can be selected by pressing the respective numeric key on the remote
  control.
- The channel data in 'channels.conf' now contains the teletext PID (thanks to
  Dave Chapman). Existing files will be read normally (and the teletext PID set
  to 0), but once they are written back (due to some channel editing) the file
  will have the new format.
- The EPG scanner now scans each transponder only once per cycle.
- Deleted recordings are now automatically removed from disk after a while (not
  only when disk space is being needed for a new recording).
- Fixed repeat function in LIRC remote control.
- Changed the MAXDVBAPI macro in dvbapi.c to 4 in order to directly support the
  maximum possible number of DVB cards.
- The 'Ca' parameter in the default 'channels.conf' has been changed from '2'
  to '3' because the VDR prototype now has 3 DVB cards (and currently the CAM
  module only works if it is inserted into the last DVB card).
- The "Now", "Next" and "Schedule" menus now remember the current channel and
  restore the list when switching between them.
- The "Green" button in the "Recordings" menu can now be used to rewind a
  recording and play it from the very beginning.
- Fixed handling ':' in timer filenames and '\n' in timer summaries (see FORMATS).
- When removing recordings empty directories are now removed from the video
  directory.
- Added the "schnitt" tools from Matthias Schniedermeyer.
- New SVDRP command MESG to display a short message on the OSD.
- The Perl script 'svdrpsend.pl' can be used to send SVDRP commands to VDR.
- SVDRP can now immediately reuse the same port if VDR is restarted.
- SVDRP now has a timeout after which the connection is automatically closed
  (default is 300 seconds, can be changed in "Setup").
- The compile time switch VFAT can be used to make VDR avoid the ':' character
  in file names (VFAT can't handle them). Do 'make VFAT=1' to enable this.
- Support for DVB-C (thanks to Hans-Peter Raschke and Peter Hofmann).
  See the INSTALL file for more information about the use of VDR with cable.
- Fixed an occasional segfault in the EIT processor.
- A value of '0' for the EPGScanTimeout setup parameter now completely turns off
  scanning for EPG data on both single and multiple card systems.
- New setup parameter "PrimaryLimit" that allows to prevent timers from using the
  primary DVB interface in multi card systems. Default value is 0, which means
  that every timer may use the primary interface.
- The 'active' field of a timer will now be explicitly set to '1' if the user
  modifies an active timer (see FORMATS for details).
- The new command line option -w can be used to activate a watchdog that makes
  VDR exit in case the main program loop does not respond for more than the
  given number of seconds. This is mainly useful in combination with the new
  'runvdr' script that restarts VDR in case is has exited.

2001-04-01: Version 0.72

- Fixed SVDRP commands LSTC and LSTT to make them return an error message if
  no channels or timers are defined.
- Enhanced 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Hans-Peter Raschke).
- Fixed switching to another channel via the EPG while a recording is being
  replayed.
- Fixed a memory leak in the EIT processor that happened when the system time
  was set.
- Removed some redundant code from the cListBase destructor.
- Fixed internationalization of some "Main" menu texts.
- Updated 'channels.conf' after the recent changes of Premiere World (thanks
  to Axel Gruber).
- Redesigned the ring buffer to make it work with two separate threads for
  input and output (also prepared for using a remultiplexer).
- Fixed setting system time from transponders.
- Fixed a segfault in the Schedule menu in case there is no EPG information.
- The 'runvdr' script now kills any leftover vdr threads before restarting it.
- Fixed a problem with Daylight Saving Time when displaying the times of
  recordings.
- Added Dutch language texts (thanks to Arnold Niessen).
- The new command line option -t can be used to set the controlling terminal
  (thanks to Jürgen Sauer). This is especially useful when starting VDR through
  an entry in /etc/inittab (see INSTALL).
- Since the CAM module only works if it is installed in the "highest" DVB card,
  recordings now search for a free DVB card from lowest to highest index (as
  opposed to the previous "highest to lowest" search) in order to not use the
  CAM card for FTA recordings unless necessary. This is only important for
  systems with three or more DVB cards.
- Added the "statdvb2vdr" tool from Hans-Peter Raschke.
- Fixed a segfault that sometimes happened when killing VDR.
- VDR now returns an exit status of '2' in case of an error at startup, instead
  of terminating with 'abort()' (which caused a core dump).
- SVDRP now also works with clients that don't do line buffering (like the
  Windows 'telnet').
- Empty lines in config files no longer cause error messages.
- New SVDRP command LSTE to list the EPG data.
- The SVDRP HELP command now prints the topics in several columns.

2001-06-02: Version 0.80

- VDR now requires driver version 0.9.0 or higher.
- Switched to the "new API" (thanks to Dave Chapman for his great support in
  this task).
- New setup parameter "LnbSLOF" that defines the switching frequency of the LNB.
- Fixed a bug in the EPG scanner with more than one DVB card.
- Fixed checking for free disk space, so that it works with NFS mounted drives.
- Files are now created with mode 644.
- Fixed checking the exit status in the 'runvdr' script.
- Activated loading the driver in 'runvdr'. Please read the comments in 'runvdr'
  for details.
- The new "emergency exit" feature automatically triggers a restart of VDR (if
  used with 'runvdr', otherwise it simply exists) if
  * tuning the channel for a recording fails
  * no useful data is received within the first 1MB of a recording
  * no data is received within a recording for more than 5 seconds
  This should make sure that a recording is successfully restarted after any
  problems.
- Processing the EIT data is now disabled during replay and 'Transfer Mode' in
  order to avoid video and audio glitches (there appears to be a bandwidth
  problem somewhere in the driver/firmware/hardware).
- Due to the reduced amount of OSD memory provided by the driver the number of
  lines in the OSD had to be reduced by 2. By rearranging some of the display
  items the amount of visible information remained the same as before, though.
  If your DVB card has even less memory (which would result in only the
  channel switching display and the replay progress display being visible, but
  no "Main" menu), try reducing the constant 'MenuLines' in dvbapi.h (currently
  '13') even further.
- There are two new setup parameters to define the "Default Priority" and
  "Default Lifetime" when creating a new timer event.
- The meaning of the "Lifetime" parameter has been modified: a value of '99'
  now means that the recording will live "forever", and a value of '0' means
  that the recording has no guaranteed lifetime and will be deleted whenever
  a new recording with higher priority needs disk space.
- Updated version of Matthias Schniedermeyer's 'schnitt' tools.
- New 'master-timer' tool (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer).

2001-06-12: Version 0.81

- Fixed handling the case where the driver reports EAGAIN during recording,
  but no data comes within 5 seconds.
- Fixed EPG scanning on single DVB card systems.
- There can now be two audio PIDs per channel, which can be toggled via the
  "Green" button in the "Main" menu. The "Edit Channel" menu therefore now
  has two audio PID fields (Apid1 and Apid2). By default, Apid2 is 0, which
  means there is no alternate audio track.
- Fixed replaying in case the driver reports EAGAIN.
- Now 'runvdr' checks if the driver is already loaded (thanks to Henning
  Holtschneider).
- Fixed removing recordings with Lifetime = 99.
- Improved channel switching.

2001-06-16: Version 0.82

- Increased timeout until reporting "broken video data stream" when recording.
- Increased amount of non-useful data received by cRemux before assuming the
  recording will fail.
- If there are two audio PIDs defined for a channel, both audio tracks will
  now be recorded and can be selectively replayed later. See the FORMATS file
  for details on how these different audio tracks are stored in the recorded
  files. In order for this to work properly you need to use a driver version
  dated 2001-06-16 or later, where the default PES filter buffer size has been
  reduced. This will create packets for the second audio track that are small
  enough to multiplex smoothly with the video data.
- Fixed a bug in the editing mechanism (didn't work with recordings that
  consist of more than one data file).
- The compile time switch VFAT has been fixed to recognize the ':' character
  in recording names, too.
- Setting all PIDs to 0x1FFF before switching channel.
- New setup parameter "VideoFormat" to define the aspect ratio of the tv set
  in use (4:3 or 16:9).

2001-06-26: Version 0.83

- Avoiding "Device or resource busy" error message when setting PIDs.
- Added Portuguese language texts (thanks to Paulo Lopes).
- Recording and replaying Dolby Digital (AC3) sound.
- No longer getting stuck when a channel doesn't sync while switching
  with the 'Up' and 'Down' keys.

2001-07-22: Version 0.84

- Fixed video packet scanning to make it recognize the whole range of
  allowed video packet ids.
- Added an additional "emergency exit" in case channel switching doesn't
  work several times in a row (when will the driver finally become stable
  enough to allow rock solid channel switching??).
- No longer sending a Diseqc command if the Diseqc value for a given channel
  is '0'. Previously this caused problems with some multi-switches (thanks to
  Markus Lang and Ulrich Röder).
- When switching channels by entering the channel number via the numeric keys
  on the remote control, the channel number displayed is now followed by the
  '-' character to indicate that additional digits can be entered.
- Increased the timeout for numeric channel switching from 500ms to 1s.
- Fixed handling the "Green" button in the "Schedules" menu for channels that
  have a second audio PID.
- Fixed high system load when displaying a still picture in replay.
- Fixed a hanging SVDRP connection if the client dies without issuing QUIT.
- Increased the frame buffer size to 192KB.
- Removed a superfluous VIDEO_FREEZE call in the replay buffer.
- Added French language texts (thanks to Jean-Claude Repetto).
- Modified OSD to use 2bpp windows (4 colors) in order to work with less
  memory, allow a larger OSD window and be faster. The group separators in the
  "Channels" menu had to be given a different color.
- Moved the channel display to the bottom of the screen.
- Displaying the frame counter in the replay progress display only when editing
  a mark.
- Fixed handling characters above 0xEF in SVDRP.
- Fixed a possible crash in parsing incorrect lines in 'channels.conf'.
- New channel settings for Premiere World (Dolby Digital PIDs not yet
  available).
- Increased the buffer for key names received from LIRC (thanks to Andre
  Valentin).
- Fixed handling a channel group separator at the very beginning of the
  'channels.conf' file.

2001-07-29: Version 0.85

- Added Norwegian language texts (thanks to Jørgen Tvedt).
- Increased the usleep value in cDvbOsd::Cmd() to 5000 in order to work on
  systems with the KURT/utime-patch (thanks to Guido Fiala).
- Changed the check whether the driver is loaded in runvdr to check for the
  'dvb' module (the last one loaded).
- Fixed repeat function with LIRC (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Increased the upper limit for the symbol rate to 30000 (thanks to Ulrich
  Röder).
- Made the position of the channel display configurable (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Made the width and height of the OSD configurable (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- DiSEqC support can now be generally enabled/disabled in the Setup menu. This
  may be necessary if your multiswitch gets irritated by the default DiSEqC
  codes '0' (thanks to Markus Lang).
- Fixed replaying in case there is no index file.
- Fixed jumping to an editing mark when replay has been paused.
- Avoiding unnecessary code execution in the replay progress display (thanks
  to Guido Fiala).
- When entering time values the digits that still have to be entered are now
  shown as '-' (as in "1-:--").
- When setting an editing mark while the progress display is not active, the
  display will now be turned on for a short while to indicate the successful
  setting of the mark.
- Updated 'channels.conf' for Premiere World (thanks to Mel Schächner).
  Check your timers if you use this channels.conf file, since the sequence of
  several PW channels has been changed.
- Changed the color of "Info" messages to "black on green" and that of the
  confirmation messages (like "Delete...") to "black on yellow".
- Fixed display with DEBUG_OSD (it still crashes sometimes, esp. when replaying,
  but I can't seem to find what causes this... any ideas anybody?).
- Avoiding audio/video distortions in 'Transfer Mode' by no longer actually
  tuning the primary interface (which can't receive this channel, anyway).
  Apparently the driver gets irritated when the channel is switched and a
  replay session is started immediately after that.
- Increased timeout until reporting "video data stream broken" when recording.
- Explicitly switching back to the previously active channel after ending a
  replay session (to have it shown correctly in case it was in 'Transfer Mode').

2001-08-06: Version 0.90

- Modified the display of the channel group separators (thanks to Markus Lang
  for this suggestion).
- Added support for replaying DVDs (thanks to Andreas Schultz). See INSTALL for
  instructions on how to compile VDR with DVD support.
- Fixed replay progress display in case replay is paused while watching an
  ongoing recording.
- Ringbuffer uses semaphores to signal empty/full conditions.
- Fixed calculating the timeout value in cFile::FileReady() (thanks to
  Wolfgang Henselmann-Weiss).

2001-08-12: Version 0.91

- Fixed displaying colored button texts that are too long.
- Suppressing replay progress display when replaying a DVD.
- Updated channels.conf.cable (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Updated French OSD texts (thanks to Jean-Claude Repetto).
- Improved AC3 decoding when replaying DVDs (thanks to Matjaz Thaler).
- Fixed handling DVB card indexes when using only one card in a multi-card
  system.
- Changed the 'Eject DVD' button text to a simple 'Eject' (the German text
  was too long...).
- Made the font file generation more stable (thanks to Artur Skawina).
- Changed the default value for the "DiSEqC" setup parameter to "off".
- The new command line option '-E' can be used to define where the EPG data
  shall be written to. This is especially useful if VDR runs in a system
  that turns off the video disk when it is not used, and therefore needs
  to write the EPG file to a ramdisk (or turn off writing it altogether).
  See 'vdr --help' for details.
- Making sure the disk is up and running before starting recording (this
  is important for systems that turn off the video disk when it is not used).
- Added the "Jump" function in replay mode (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
  See the description of the "Red" key in MANUAL under "Replay Control" for
  details.
- Fixed displaying editing marks when toggling a mark in "pause" mode.
- If there is no free DVB device to record, the log message will now be given
  only once.
- Made I/O more robust by handling EINTR (thanks to Werner Fink).

2001-08-18: Version 0.92

- The "channel not sync'ed" log message now also lists the card number.
- Now using the EIT services from 'libdtv' (thanks to Rolf Hakenes), which
  provides EPG information for NVOD ("Near Video On Demand") channels.
- Doing some bug fixing on the EPG data (some tv stations apparently have
  their own idea on how to fill in the data...). The level up to which EPG
  bugs are fixed can be controlled with the EPGBugfixLevel parameter in the
  "Setup" menu (see MANUAL for details, and cEventInfo::FixEpgBugs() in eit.c
  for the actual implementation).
- Fixed broken recordings after a driver buffer overflow.
- Fixed the chirping sound after Pause/Play of a DVD (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz).

2001-08-26: Version 0.93

- The menus and the channel display now show the current date and time.
- The new Setup parameter MaxVideoFileSize can be used to customize the
  maximum size of the recorded video files.
- Fixed a bug in handling repeating timers that record over midnight (the
  calculation of matching timers has been completely rewritten).
- Timers that are currently recording are now marked with '#' in the "Timers"
  menu.
- Timers are now sorted in the "Timers" menu, showing the sequence in which
  they will be recording. This can be disabled in the "Setup" menu. Note
  that the "Mark" button doesn't work if timers are displayed sorted.

2001-09-02: Version 0.94

- Implemented automatic shutdown (see INSTALL and MANUAL for details).
- New SVDRP command NEXT to show the next timer event.
- The new remote control key "Power" can be used to turn the VDR machine
  off (this requires the presence of the '-s' option).
- Fixed code for the default "Ok" button on the PC keyboard (was 0x162 on
  the "good old" keyboards (with the F-keys at the left side), while it changed
  to 0x15E on the newer keyboards).
- When a recording is edited, the summary information (if present) is now
  also copied.
- When a recording is running on the primary interface, any attempt to change
  the current channel will now lead to a "Channel locked" message.
- The main program loop now first checks whether any timer recordings are
  finished, before starting a new timer recording. This is important in case
  one timer ends at the same time another timer starts.
- New setup parameter OSDMessageTime to define how long an OSD message shall
  be displayed.
- The "File" parameter of a timer can now contain the '~' character to store
  the recording in a hierarchical directory structure. The '~' character has
  been chosen since the file system's directory delimiter '/' may be part of
  a regular programme name (showing the directory hierarchy in the "Recordings"
  menu will follow later).
- Repeating timers now create recordings that contain the 'Subtitle' information
  from the EPG data in their file name. Typically (on tv stations that care
  about their viewers) this contains the episode title of a series. The
  subtitle is appended to the timer's file name, separated by a '~' character,
  so that it results in all recordings of this timer being collected in a
  common subdirectory. You can disable this with the 'UseSubtitle' parameter
  in the "Setup" menu.
- The summary information is now taken from the EPG data at the actual time of
  recording (no longer at the time the timer is created in the "Schedule" menu).
  If a timer already has summary data, that data will be used. If you have
  repeating timers in your 'timers.conf', you may want to make sure they do
  NOT contain any summary information (that's the last field in the timer
  definitions). Use your favourite text editor to delete that information.
  That way every recording will store the actual summary data at the time of
  the recording.

2001-09-16: Version 0.95

- Fixed behaviour in case the shutdown didn't take place (there were many
  "next timer event at..." messages in that case).
- Reduced the default value for MinEventTimeout to 30 minutes.
- Fixed detecting manual start in shutdown feature.
- An error message is now displayed in case the 'Transfer Mode' can't be
  started because the necessary DVB card is currently recording (or there
  is no DVB card that can access this channel).
- Fixed toggling channels with the '0' key in case the "Ok" button has been
  pressed to display the current/next information.
- Pressing the "Power" key now always initiates the shutdown sequence (after
  user confirmation in case of a recording timer), event if there is currently
  a menu or a replay session active. Note the additional remarks in INSTALL
  regarding the values of the two parameters given to the shutdown program
  in case of a currently recording timer.
- Switching through channel groups with the "Left" and "Right" keys now
  always starts at the group that contains the current channel.
- Implemented "Multi Speed Mode" (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Implemented backtracing to hit the right spot after fast forward/rewind
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Implemented replay mode display (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt, with a few
  rewrites by kls).
- Changed the size of all input buffers used to parse config files or receive
  SVDRP commands to the same value of 10KB. This allows long strings to be
  used in the 'summary' field of a timer, for instance.
- The pipe to the Dolby Digital replay command (option '-a') now closes all
  unused file descriptors in the child process to avoid crashing when the
  OSD is used (thanks to Andreas Vitting).
- Switched to the driver's new tuning API (VDR now requires a driver version
  dated 2001-09-14 or higher).
- Changed obsolete macro VIDEO_WINDOW_CHROMAKEY to VID_TYPE_CHROMAKEY (thanks
  to Guido Fiala).
- New version of the "Master-Timer" tool (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- Better error handling when writing configuration files.
- Fixed putting the final editing mark into the edited version's marks file.
- Fixed manipulating an editing mark at the very end of a recording.
- Fixed starting a new replay immediately after stopping a previous one (had
  caused a mix between live video and replay).
- Three new keys ("Volume+", Volume-" and "Mute") to control the DVB card's
  audio output volume.
- New version of the 'epg2timers' tool (thanks to Carsten Koch).

2001-09-23: Version 0.96

- Made VDR compile with libdvdread-0.9.1 (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
  Note that you now _need_ version 0.9.1 of libdvdread to compile VDR with
  DVD support!
- Several fixes to the replay mode display (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt):
  no more replay mode display when pressing the "Green" or "Yellow" button
  (Skip +/-60s); fixed timeout when pressing '0' to set an editing mark while
  the progress display is not shown; mode display is shown after progress
  display is closed; pressing "Ok" while the mode display is on brings up
  the progress display; no more unnecessary display of "normal play mode".
- Supplying the new frontend parameter 'Inversion' (currently it is always
  set to INVERSION_AUTO, which should work with all channels on Astra).
- Removing unnecessary double quotes from EPG Subtitle in EPGBugfixLevel >=1.
- EPG info is now updated if the contents changes but the ID remains the same.
- Fixed handling SVDRP commands with more than one blank between the command
  word and the options.
- The current volume setting is now saved to setup.conf and restored at the
  next program start.
- New command line option '-r' to define a command that gets called before and
  after each recording (see INSTALL for details).
- Implemented a check to see whether the system time is running linearly.
- Writing the current time (as seen by VDR) into the log file when starting
  a timer recording (this may help debugging cases where timers don't start
  at the expected time).
- Made the volume, mute and power keys work when a menu is active, too (thanks
  to Matthias Weingart).

2001-10-21: Version 0.97

- Implemented a lock file to prevent more than one instance of VDR from removing
  files from the video directory at the same time.
- The new setup parameter SplitEditedFiles can be used to control whether or
  not the result of an editing process shall be written into separate files.
- Fixed handling repeat function when using LIRC (thanks to Matthias Weingart).
- The shutdown program (defined with the '-s' option) now also gets the channel
  number and recording title of the timer (see INSTALL).
- New channel data for 'Premiere One', 'Premiere X-Action', 'Fox Kids Türkce'
  and 'N24' (thanks to Andreas Share, Ulrich Röder, Uwe Scheffler and Simon
  Bauschulte). Note that if you are using the default 'channels.conf' or
  'channels.conf.cable' files you may need to check any exiting timers to see
  whether they still use the correct channel number.
- Fixed the "EPG bugfix" (sometimes had duplicate information in Subtitle and
  Extended Description).
- Fixed checking for valid video device when setting the video mode.
- The external command 'sort' is no longer required. VDR now sorts the list of
  recordings itself, making sure that recordings that stem from repeating timers
  are sorted chronologically. Sorting is done according to the setting of the
  current locale, so you may want to make sure LC_COLLATE is set to the desired
  value (see INSTALL).
- Fixed handling 'newline' characters in EPG texts (thanks to Rolf Hakenes for
  an improved version of his 'libdtv').
  Newline characters are always mapped to a single "blank" in VDR, because they
  would otherwise disturb the Title and Subtitle layout in the channel display
  (where these are assumed to be single line texts) and would have to be
  specially handled in the 'epg.data' file and the LSTE command in SVDRP.
- Mapping ` ("backtick") characters in EPG texts to ' (single quote).
- Fixed timers starting and ending at unexpected times. 'localtime()' was not
  thread safe, now using localtime_r().
- Removed the "system time seen..." message.
- Fixed a bug in the replay mode display when pressing the Green or Yellow
  button while in trick mode (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt)
- Closing all open file descriptors when calling external programs.
- The menu timeout now also works when pressing the "Back" button during replay
  to enter the "Recordings" menu.
- Updated 'channels.conf' for the "Bundesliga" channels of Premiere World
  (thanks to Mel Schächner).
- Fixed reading timers.conf and channels.conf that contain blanks after numeric
  values.
- Fixed handling trick modes near the beginning and end of a recording.
- Pressing the "Back" button while replaying a DVD now leads to the DVD menu.

2001-11-04: Version 0.98

- Completed storing the current audio volume in the setup.conf file (thanks
  to Andy Grobb).
- Fixed closing the progress display with the "Back" key when in trick mode
  and Setup.ShowReplayMode is enabled (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- New SVDRP commands LSTR and DELR to list and delete recordings (thanks to
  Thomas Heiligenmann).
- Fixed a crash when pressing the '2' button while replaying a DVD.
- Updated 'channels.conf' for the "Bundesliga" channels of Premiere World
  (thanks to Mel Schächner).
- Changed the tuning code to use FrontendInfo to detect the type of DVB card.
- Removed the recursion stuff from cThread (cMutex already does this).
- Fixed handling the repeat function in the channel display.
- Avoiding multiple EPG entries for the same event (thanks to Rolf Hakenes
  for some valuable information on how to do this).
- A recording on the primary interface can now be stopped to make it continue
  on an other free DVB card (if one is free at the moment). See MANUAL for
  details.
- Added some missing teletext PIDs (thanks to Norbert Schmidt).
- Added PTS to the converted PCM audio when replaying a DVD (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz). Now the audio and video of a DVD replayed over the DVB card's A/V
  out should always be in sync.
- Fixed handling the "Power" key in case Setup.MinUserInactivity is set to 0 to
  disable automatic shutdown.
- Added a fifth parameter to the 'shutdown' call that indicates the reason for
  this shutdown request (see INSTALL).
- Fixed releasing 'index' memory after recording or playback.
- Fixed ejecting a DVD while it is being replayed.
- Removed all video overlay stuff from cDvbApi and SVDRP. Guido Fiala's new
  'kvdr' version 0.4 now does these things itself. As a consequence of this you
  will now need to use kvdr 0.4 or later.
- The device /dev/video is now opened only if necessary (to GRAB an image),
  allowing other programs (like 'kvdr', for instance) to use that device.

2001-11-25: Version 0.99pre1

- Fixed several channel definitions in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Thilo
  Wunderlich).
- Added MPEG audio support for DVD (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Implemented DVB-T support (thanks to Dave Chapman).
  This currently works only for UK channels.
- Removed the range limits for the Frequency and Srate parameters of channel
  definitions.
- Changed the maximum value for PIDs in channels.conf from 0xFFFE to 0x1FFF.
- Fixed DVD audio sync problems (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Fixed external AC3 replay for DVDs (thanks to Andreas Schultz).

2002-01-27: Version 0.99pre2

- Fixed setting the OSD size in the 'Confirm' interface call (thanks to
  Deti Fliegl).
- Removed the 'read incomplete section...' error message in the EIT processor.
- Fixed channel data for "DW TV" (thanks to Axel Gruber).
- Added DPID to "PREMIERE MOVIE 1" in channels.conf.cable (thanks to Stephan
  Schreiber).
- Prepared the OSD functions for multiple overlapping windows.
- Removed the check to see whether the system time is running linearly.
- Improved performance of SVDRP command entry.
- Removed EPGBugfixLevel '3' - after more than a year Pro-7 finally managed to
  broadcast the correct timestamps for EPG events between 0:00 and 6:00!
- Fixed failing watchdog timer if program hangs in OSD activities (thanks to
  Carsten Koch).
- No longer requiring 'libncurses' if compiling without DEBUG_OSD=1 and
  REMOTE=KBD (thanks to Lauri Pesonen).
- The "Recordings" menu now displays a hierarchical structure if there are
  subdirectories for the recordings. This can be controlled through the
  "RecordingDirs" parameter in the "Setup" menu.
  See "MANUAL/Replaying a Recording" for details.
- Improved speed of setting the Help button texts.
- Fixed handling file names that contain single quotes (') or dollar signs ($)
  in the call to the shutdown command (option '-s') and the recording command
  (option '-r').
- Improved error handling in the editing process; the resulting file will be
  deleted if an error occurred.
- A message is now prompted at the end of the editing process, indicating
  whether the process succeeded or failed.
- Fixed setting the LastActivity timestamp after a shutdown prompt (thanks to
  Sergei Haller).
- A message is now prompted if free disk space becomes low during recording.
- The editing process now calls AssertFreeDiskSpace() to remove deleted
  recordings if the disk becomes full.
- The "Main" menu now displays in its title the used disk space (in percent)
  and the estimated free disk space (in hh:mm), assuming a data rate of 30 MB
  per minute.
- Activating the "Recordings" menu now displays "scanning recordings..." to
  give the user some feedback in case this takes longer.
- Status messages are now displayed centered.
- Removed the 'Tools' subdirectory from the VDR archive. All contributed tools
  can now be found at ftp://ftp.tvdr.de/vdr/Tools.

2002-01-29: Version 0.99pre3

- Fixed handling improper buffer lengths in the EIT parser (thanks to Deti
  Fliegl).

2002-01-30: Version 0.99pre4

- Fixed handling improperly formatted EIT data (thanks to Rolf Hakenes).

2002-02-03: Version 0.99pre5

- Updated channel settings for 'N24' (thanks to Andreas Gebel).
- Fixed handling hierarchical recordings menu in case of directories starting
  with the same sequence of characters.
- Fixed handling timers on the 29th, 30th or 31st of a month in case the next
  month has less than 31 days.
- Added a description of the sort order of individual episodes in the
  recordings menu to the MANUAL.
- Removed the EPG bugfix for "Title / Subtitle" cleanup. Apparently Pro-7 has
  finally stopped this nasty habit.
- Added some EPG bugfix statistics (printed to the log file every time the EPG
  data is cleaned up and when VDR is terminated). Maybe somebody in charge of
  the EPG data at the listed channels will read this and take the necessary
  actions to fix these things...
- Changed the [dei]syslog macros in tools.h to use a variable number of args,
  thus making it safe to use them in nested 'if/else' statements.
- Fixed error handling in establishing an SVDRP connection (thanks to Davide
  Achilli for pointing out this one).
- The new configuration file 'svdrphosts.conf' is now used to define which
  hosts may access the SVDRP port (by default only 'localhost' has access).
  See FORMATS for details.
- The special keywords TITLE and EPISODE can now be used in timer file names
  (see MANUAL and FORMATS for details).
- The new setup parameter NameInstantRecord can be used to define how an
  instant recording will be named (see MANUAL for details).
- When looking for the EPG record of the timer that starts a recording, now
  that record is taken which covers the time calculated as
  'start + (Setup.MarginStart * 2) + 1)' in order to have a better chance of
  hitting the right record in case of an instant recording. Timers that start
  further in the future should always be programmed via the "Schedules" menu.
- The special VPIDs '0' and '1' are now used to enable recording radio channels.
  Actually '0' should be enough, but '1' must be used with encrypted channels
  (driver bug?). Note, though, that since VDR is mainly a *video recorder*, some
  features like, e. g.,  the progress display, may not work as expected with
  radio recordings. Thanks to Michael Paar.
- Fixed a problem with the ERR macro defined by ncurses.h (thanks to Artur
  Skawina).

2002-02-10: Version 0.99

- Fixed a bug in moving timers or channels to the last position in the list
  (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer for helping to debug this one).
- Changed the estimated data rate for calculating the remaining disk capacity
  to 25.75 MB/min.
- Only reporting the 'EPG bugfix statistics' if there really were any fixes.
- Added Finnish language texts (thanks to Hannu Savolainen).
- Reverted to the previous way of searching for the EPG record of the current
  recording in case of a repeating timer (i.e. taking the one that is in the
  middle between start and end time).
- Added a typedef for 'in_addr_t' to make it work with glibc < 2.2 (thanks to
  Jürgen Schmidt).
- When the last entry in a "Recordings" menu page is deleted, that page is now
  automatically closed (suggested by Uwe Freese).
- Changed the default name for instant recordings to "TITLE EPISODE" (avoiding
  the '-').
- If Setup.ShowInfoOnChSwitch is set to "no", the box for the EPG display is no
  longer shown (thanks to Andy Grobb).
- If compiled with VFAT=1, characters that can't be handled by a VFAT system are
  now encoded to '#XX'.
- When the user presses the "Power" button and there is a timer about to start
  recording within Setup.MinEventTimeout minutes, there is now a confirmation
  prompt telling the user that there is an upcoming timer event.
- If a recording has no episode title, the trailing '~' is no longer shown in
  the progress display.

2002-02-24: Version 1.0.0pre1

- Added scanning for EPG data for another 4 days on channels that support this
  (thanks to Oleg Assovski).
- Removed '#define VFAT 1' from recording.c (was a leftover from testing).
- Fixed the "Low disk space!" message (thanks to Sergei Haller).
- Added the TPID to Hessen-3 in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Sergei Haller).
- Fixed a crash when replaying with DEBUG_OSD=1 (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Implemented the "First day" parameter for repeating timers. See FORMATS for
  information about the enhanced 'timers.conf' file format, and MANUAL for
  a description of the new item in the "Edit Timer" menu and the enhanced
  functionality of the "Blue" button in the "Timers" menu.
- When deleting a recording that is currently still being recorded, the related
  timer will now automatically be terminated. If this is a repeating timer, it
  will receive a "First day" setting that skips the timer for this day.
- Fixed closing all unused file descriptors when opening a pipe (thanks to
  Werner Fink).
- Instant recordings now take the EPG data from the point in time at 5 minutes
  from the start time of the recording. In order for this to work the 'active'
  parameter of a timer now uses the second bit to indicate that this is an
  "instant" recording (see FORMATS for details).
- Fixed the SVDRP GRAB command in case the video device can't be opened (thanks
  to Adrian Stabiszewski).
- At startup the data written into 'epg.data' is now read into the EPG data
  structures. In order for this to work, the 'E' record has been extended to
  (optionally) contain the 'table ID' (see FORMATS for details).
- The new SVDRP command PUTE can be used to put EPG data into the EPG list.
  See FORMATS for details about the required data format.
- Taking the German umlauts 'as is' when compiled with VFAT.
- The new Setup parameter RecordDolbyDigital can be used to generally turn off
  recording the Dolby Digital audio channels in case you want to save disk space
  or don't have the equipment to replay Dolby Digital audio.
- Reading the 'setup.conf' file no longer terminates in case of an error, but
  rather attempts to read the rest of the file.
- Removed DVD support from the core VDR source, since the current version from
  Andreas Schultz is already much further developed (DVD menu navigation) and
  the concept of "additional players" in VDR is going to change in version 1.1.0,
  where a new "plugin" interface shall allow the easy implementation of new
  players without having to patch the core VDR source. Until then, Andreas has
  agreed to provide his DVD support as a completely external patch.
- The contents of the distribution archive now contains the directory name with
  the current version number, as in 'vdr-1.0.0pre1/...' in order to avoid
  inadvertently overwriting an existing VDR directory with a new version.
- Added a missing error message in SVDRP command LSTC in case the given channel
  can't be found.

2002-02-25: Version 1.0.0pre2

- Fixed a crash in case there is no 'epg.data' at program start (thanks to
  Andreas Schultz).

2002-03-03: Version 1.0.0pre3

- Fixed parsing 'E' records in epg2html.pl.
- Fixed a deadlock when switching channels via Schedule/Now|Next/Switch (reported
  by Martin Hammerschmid).
- Changed the meaning of the 'Ca' parameter in 'channels.conf'. Each channel can
  now define which decryption method it needs in order to be accessed. The new
  configuration file 'ca.conf' contains the defined values, and the default
  'channels.conf' has been modified to contain the new values for 'Premiere World'
  and 'ORF'. If you use the default 'channels.conf' and have the conditional
  access hardware to receive encrypted channels, please make sure you copy the
  file 'ca.conf' into your /video directory (or wherever your configuration files
  are located) and go into the "Setup" menu and set the CICAM values according
  to your hardware setup. Currently there are two possible CICAM entries per
  DVB card, so any card can implement up to two different conditional access
  modes (besides the default "Free To Air" mode, which is always assumed to be
  available on any DVB card).
- Updated French language texts (thanks to Jean-Claude Repetto).

2002-03-17: Version 1.0.0pre4

- Added 'Ca' code 201 for 'Cryptoworks, GOD-DIGITAL' to 'ca.conf' (thanks to
  Bernd Schweikert).
- Fixed avoiding the primary DVB interface in case Setup.PrimaryLimit is 0.
- Fixed handling CICAM settings if the first one of a DVB card was FTA.
- Fixed reacting on changes in CICAM settings (needed to restart VDR before).
- The "Blue" button in the "Main" menu now works as "Stop" button if a recording
  is currently being replayed.
- New command line option '-m' to mute audio of the primary DVB device at
  startup (suggested by Mirko Günther).
- The new SVDRP command VOLU can be used to control the audio volume (suggested
  by Mirko Günther).
- Fixed resetting 'mute' state when setting the volume to a non-zero value.
- Added log messages when deleting recordings in case the disk runs full while
  recording.
- Fixed closing a pipe (used for replaying Dolby Digital audio), which
  sometimes left 'zombie' processes behind (thanks to Werner Fink for helping
  to debug this one).
- Now starting the Dolby Digital output thread only if the recording actually
  contains Dolby Digital audio data (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Implemented OSD for Volume and Mute (works only if there is no other OSD
  activity, but this should be no problem for normal use).
- Changed the MANUAL description of the "Conditional Access" setup parameters
  to reflect the actual "CICAM DVBn m" notation in the "Setup" menu.
- The new Setup parameter "Use time from transponder" can be used to define which
  transponder shall be used to set the system time (see MANUAL for details).
  If you have been using the SetSystemTime option previously, you now MUST
  select a channel that you trust to have a reliable time base.
- Grouped the Setup parameters into several sub-menus, so that each group of
  parameters fits on a single screen - unless the height of the OSD has been
  set to a small value (based on code from Markus Lang).
- Changed the title of the "Main" menu to "VDR".
- Fixed displaying a system message while the replay mode is being shown.
- Physically removing a deleted recording if one with the same name shall be
  deleted again.
- The "Left" and "Right" keys are now used to page up and down in text displays
  (like the EPG descriptions or the results of commands executed from the
  "Commands" menu).
- Fixed high CPU usage in 'Transfer Mode'.
- Replaced 'killproc' with 'killall' in 'runvdr', since apparently 'killproc'
  is not available by default on some Linux distributions, whereas 'killall' is.
  Please check if your system provides 'killall' - if it doesn't, please change
  this back in 'runvdr' and report this (thanks to Achim Lange).
- The "Commands" menu now automatically assigns number keys as hotkeys to the
  commands. If you have preceded your commands with digits you may want to
  remove these from your 'commands.conf' file.
- The new Setup item "Restart" can be used to force a complete restart of VDR,
  including reloading the driver. Note that this can only work if VDR and the
  driver are wrapped into a mechanism that actually performs this action if VDR
  exits. The 'runvdr' script can be used for this purpose.
- Refined texts of the "Setup" menu.

2002-04-01: Version 1.0.0pre5

- Fixed restoring CICAM setup values for a fourth DVB card (thanks to Klaus Wolf).
- Completed internationalization of OSD texts (thanks to Hannu Savolainen,
  Arnold Niessen, Paulo Lopes, Jean-Claude Repetto, Alberto Carraro, Matjaz
  Thaler and Truls Slevigen).
- Improved file I/O in case of EINTR, which may occur e.g. with heavy system
  load (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Now writing the title of a recording into the 'summary.vdr' file.
- Workaround for displaying still frames with the unpatched LinuxDVB driver
  (if anybody ever finds out why the unpatched driver doesn't display VDR's
  still frames, please let me know).
- When executing a command from the "Commands" menu, the title of that command
  is now immediately shown in the status line (followed by "...") to give the
  user some feedback that the command is being executed, which is especially
  important if this takes some time.
- Fixed scrolling the "Channels" menu in case the cursor ends up on a group
  delimiter (thanks to Bernd Zierath for helping to debug this one).
- Added manual pages vdr(1) and vdr(5) (which made the FORMATS file obsolete).
- New command command line option '-V' to display the VDR version.
- Adjusting column width for channel numbers in case there are more than 999
  channels.
- Checking the return value of '...FileReady...' calls in dvbapi.c for better
  performance under heavy system load.
- New 'make' target 'install', which copies the manual pages and executables
  to their appropriate system locations and creates the /video directory if
  it doesn't exist yet.
- Automatic hotkey assignment is now suppressed if the first entry in
  'commands.conf' starts with a digit in the range '1'...'9', followed by a blank.
- Fixed a bug in switching back the replay mode display in time shift mode
  (thanks to Achim Lange for reporting this one).
- Fixed a bug in the "First day" timer parameter for timers that record over
  midnight.
- Added units to Setup parameters.
- Changed time entry in the 'Jump' command during replay, so that it is filled
  up from right to left.
- Now using statfs() to determine the amount of free disk space, which avoids
  the use of an external 'df' command (thanks to Ruben Nunez Francisco).
- Fixed skipping the next hit of a repeating timer (thanks to Rainer Zocholl
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed a bug when a timer records over midnight of a day that had a change in
  Daylight Saving Time (thanks to Mirko Dölle for reporting this one).
- Added Polish language texts (thanks to Michael Rakowski).
- Fixed a bug in parsing group separators in channels.conf (thanks to Henning
  Holtschneider for reporting this one).
- Changed the default 'Ok' key when using the PC keyboard from '5' (in the
  numeric block) to 'Enter', because the '5' key didn't work on keyboards with
  the F-keys on top.
- Fixed a bug in the EPG bugfix mechanism if the extended description is shorter
  than 3 characters (thanks to Andreas Schultz).

2002-04-07: Version 1.0.0

- Fixed a problem with wrong EPG data in the Schedules menu (thanks to Tobias
  Kerner, problem was initially reported by Michel Moster, but somehow I had
  misplaced his message...).
- Added Spanish language texts (thanks to Ruben Nunez Francisco).
- Fixed resetting the "First day" timer parameter once the timer actually starts
  recording.
- Fixed the still picture workaround in case the progress display is active
  (thanks to Gerald Raaf).
- Fixed a problem with accessing the epg.data file before it is fully written
  (thanks to Thilo Wunderlich for reporting this one).
- Now the EPG scan skips channels that have their 'Ca' parameter explicitly set
  to an other DVB card (suggested by Sergei Haller).
- Fixed a possible hangup when reading a broken epg.data file (thanks to Henning
  Holtschneider for pointing out this one).
- Fixed a bug in the editing process in case a previously edited file with the
  same name was manually deleted on a system with more than one video directory
  (thanks to Dirk Wiebel for reporting this one).

2002-04-21: Version 1.0.1

- Added some DVB-T channels for Berlin (Germany) to channels.conf.terr (thanks to
  Andreas Roedl).
- Implemented enhanced string editing with upper-/lowercase, insert/overwrite
  and delete (thanks to Sergei Haller).
- Fixed color palette handling on "big endian" systems (thanks to Jean Martin
  for pointing out this one).
- Updated the "Blue Movie" channels to the new "Premiere Erotik" (thanks to
  Thilo Wunderlich). NOTE: this adds a new channel to 'channels.conf', so that
  any timers referencing a channel with a number higher than 102 should be
  checked and adapted if necessary (this only applies if you are using the default
  'channels.conf').
- Improved thread locking in the ring buffer to avoid possible race conditions
  under heavy load (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Fixed a crash when selecting the "Jump" function directly after setting an
  editing mark (thanks to Steffen Koch for reporting and Stefan Huelswitt for
  fixing this one).
- Fixed some missing ',' in i18n.c (thanks to Matthias Hilbig).
- Fixed a possible endless loop in shifting recordings between DVB cards (thanks
  to Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Updated the Premiere World Formula 1 channels in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Mel
  Schächner).
- No longer setting PIDs 0x1FFF, which apparently fixes problems with CAMs and
  AC3 sound only working the first time (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Now encoding '.' at the end of a directory name in case of VFAT=1, since Windows
  can't handle these (thanks to Simon Dean for reporting this one).

2002-05-05: Version 1.0.2

- Now taking an active video cutting process into account when doing shutdown or
  housekeeping (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- The default duration of an instant recording has been increased to 3 hours and
  is now configurable in the "Setup/Recording" menu.
- Added Greek language texts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Fixed the unit of the "SVDRP timeout" setup parameter (thanks to Marcus Kuba
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed a crash on systems with disks that have a block size larger than 1MB
  (thanks to Ulrich Petri for helping to debug this one).
- Updated 'channels.conf' for the new PW settings (thanks to Andreas Share,
  Carsten Koch, Gerald Raaf and Mel Schächner). Note that all channels with numbers
  over 50 may have moved, so you should carefully check any timers you have set!
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' for the new PW settings (thanks to Oliver Lorei
  Stephan Schreiber and Uwe Scheffler). Note that all channels may have moved, so
  you should carefully check any timers you have set!
  For future updates of this file somebody with digital cable should take the role
  of the "maintainer" and send me updated versions based on the file that comes
  with the most recent version of VDR. I will then simply replace the entire file
  'channels.conf.cable' whenever a new version is sent to me.
- Fixed skipping forward in time shift mode near the end of the recording (thanks
  to Andreas Böttger for reporting this one).

2002-05-09: Version 1.1.0

- Begin of the 1.1 development branch. THIS IS NOT A STABLE VERSION!
  The current stable version for every day use is still the 1.0 branch.
- First step towards a universal plugin interface. See the file PLUGINS.html
  for a detailed description. The man page vdr(1) describes the new options '-L'
  and '-P' used to load plugins. This first step implements the complete "outer"
  shell for plugins. The "inner" access to VDR data structures will follow.
- The VDR version number is now displayed in the title line of the "Setup" menu.

2002-05-11: Version 1.1.1

- Separated the actual DVB hardware OSD implementation from the abstract OSD
  interface. 'osdbase.c/.h' now implements the abstract OSD, while 'dvbosd.c/.h'
  is the actual implementation for the DVB hardware. This is in preparation for
  allowing additional kinds of OSD hardware implementations.
- Fixed leftover references to the file FORMATS in MANUAL and svdrp.c (thanks to
  Onno Kreuzinger for reporting this one).
- Avoiding ambiguities in the cList template class in case one defines a "list of
  lists" (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Simplified the basic cMenuSetupPage class for easier use in plugins.
- Added setup parameters and a Setup menu to the 'hello' plugin example.
- Fixed logging error message for unknown config parameters in plugins.
- Rearranged cleanup sequence at the end of the main program.
- Adapted PLUGINS.html to use the actual code examples from the 'hello' plugin.

2002-05-13: Version 1.1.2

- Changed the cPlugin::Start() function to return a boolean value that indicates
  if the plugin will not be able to perform its task (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added the cPlugin::Housekeeping() function (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Updated channels.conf.cable (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Added 'insert' capabilities to cList (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Changed the 'package' target in the plugin's Makefile to produce a package that
  expands to a directory with just the plugin name and version number (suggested
  by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Made the config directory available to plugins (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
  See PLUGINS.html, section "Configuration files" for details.
- Improved the [eid]syslog() macros, so that the LOG_... macros don't need to be
  given any more.

2002-05-26: Version 1.0.3

- Updated 'Premiere Sport 2' in channels.conf (thanks to Rudi Hofer).
- Fixed some function headers to make them compile with gcc 3.x (thanks to
  Gregoire Favre).
- Fixed the cutting mechanism to make it re-sync in case a frame is larger than the
  buffer (thanks to Sven Grothklags).
- Added Swedish language texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).

2002-06-10: Version 1.0.4

- Added Romanian language texts (thanks to Paul Lacatus).
- Removed compiler option '-m486' to make it work on non-Intel platforms (thanks
  to Alastair McKinstry for pointing this out).

2002-06-16: Version 1.1.3

- Improved the VDR Makefile to avoid a warning if the '.dependencies' file does
  not exist, and also using $(MAKE) to call recursive makes.
- Changed the name of the 'package' target in the plugin Makefiles to 'dist'
  (following the suggestions in the "GNU Make" manual). If you already have started
  a plugin project, you may want to change this in your Makefile accordingly.
- Improved the plugin Makefile to avoid a warning if the '.dependencies' file does
  not exist, and also using $(shell...) to get the version numbers. If you already have
  started a plugin project, you may want to change this in your Makefile accordingly.
- Fixed some function headers to make them compile with gcc 3.x (thanks to
  Gregoire Favre).
- Fixed the cutting mechanism to make it re-sync in case a frame is larger than the
  buffer (thanks to Sven Grothklags).
- Added an error message if the directory specified in the '-L' option can't be
  accessed (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Rearranged OSD class names to make 'cOsd' available for the main OSD interface.
- Completely moved OSD handling out of the cDvbApi class, into the new cOsd.
- Implemented cStatus to allow plugins to set up a status monitor.
  See PLUGINS.html for details.
- Moved the cEITScanner out of dvbapi.h/.c, into the new eitscan.h/.c.
- Added Swedish language texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).
- Fixed parsing 'E' records in epg2html.pl (thanks to Matthias Fechner for pointing
  out this one).
- Removed compiler option '-m486' to make it work on non-Intel platforms. If you
  have already started a plugin project, you may want to make sure you remove this
  option from your existing Makefile.
- Completely rearranged the recording and replay functions to make them available
  to plugins.
- Replay is now done in a single thread (no more syncing between input and output
  thread necessary).
- It is now possible to record several channels on the same transponder with "budget
  cards". VDR automatically attaches a recording timer to a card that already
  records on the appropriate transponder. How many parallel recordings can actually
  be done depends on the computer's performance. Currently any number of recordings
  gets attached to a card, so you should carefully plan your timers to not exceed
  the limit. On a K6-II/450 it was possible to record three channels from transponder
  12480 with a single WinTV NOVA-S.
- Timers that record two successive shows on the same channel may now overlap and
  will use the same DVB card. During the time where both timers record the data
  is simply saved to both files.
- The following limitations apply to this version:
  + 'Transfer Mode' doesn't work yet.
  + The '-a' option (for Dolby Digital audio) doesn't work yet.
  + Switching between different language tracks doesn't work yet.
  + Cutting doesn't work yet.

2002-06-23: Version 1.1.4

- Added Hungarian language texts (thanks to Istvan Koenigsberger and Guido Josten).
- Activated cutting.
- Activated 'Transfer Mode'.
- Moved handling of the Menu key entirely into vdr.c.
- Switched VDR's own player to the new cPlayer/cControl structures.
- Switched handling 'Transfer Mode' to the new cPlayer/cControl structures.
- The following limitations apply to this version:
  + The '-a' option (for Dolby Digital audio) doesn't work yet.
  + Switching between different language tracks doesn't work yet.

2002-07-21: Version 1.1.5

- Added direct access to the index data of cPalette (needed for displaying SPUs,
  thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- The status monitor function cStatus::Replaying() now gets a 'cControl *' argument instead
  of a 'cDvbPlayerControl *' in order to allow additional players to call this function.
  cPlayer and cControl have been given the functions GetIndex() and GetReplayMode() to
  allow access to the player's status.
- Added cOsd::OpenRaw() to create a raw OSD (needed for displaying SPUs).
- Changed the semantics of the Name parameter in cStatus::Recording() and
  cStatus::Replaying(). It is no longer the full directory name of the recording,
  but rather just the basic name. This has been changed to allow players that can't
  provide a name to simply use a string that describes the player type (like, e.g.,
  "DVD").
- Fixed a hangup when switching to the next file during replay.
- Fixed a possible race condition in the cDvbPlayer (thanks to Andreas Schultz
  for pointing out this one).
- Disabled channels on Transponder 12070 in 'channels.conf', which apparently no longer transmits.

2002-08-04: Version 1.1.6

- Re-visited the race condition fix in the cDvbPlayer (thanks again to Andreas
  Schultz).
- Changed the VFAT handling to allow users who normally use it but have forgotten
  to set it when compiling a new version of VDR to at least see their recordings
  made with VFAT enabled (thanks to Christian Rienecker).
- Added some missing teletext PIDs (thanks to Joerg Riechardt).
- Fixed PID handling for cReceiver.
- Added a missing #include to ringbuffer.c (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid).
- Now using CC, CFLAGS, CXX and CXXFLAGS in Makefile.
- Changed the cDevice class to allow plugins to implement their own devices (see
  PLUGINS.html for details).

2002-08-16: Version 1.1.7

- Adapted VDR to the NEWSTRUCT driver. To use the new driver, compile VDR with
  'make NEWSTRUCT=1' (thanks to Holger Wächtler for some valuable advice).
  By default it currently still uses the old driver.
- Added some missing #includes (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid).
- Changed the log error message "can't record MPEG1!" to "error in data stream!",
  since the mentioning of MPEG1 has irritated many people.
- Consistently using malloc/free and new/delete (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Temporarily made cDevice::ProvidesCa() virtual (Andreas Schultz needs this
  in his DXR3 plugin).
- cDevice no longer exposes a file handle to cPlayer. A derived cPlayer class
  can now call DevicePoll() to see whether the replay device is ready for
  further data. A derived cDevice class must implement Poll() and shall
  check if any of its file handles is ready for data.
- Implemented several replay modes to allow players that play only audio (thanks
  to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Improved cCondVar::Wait() and implemented cCondVar::TimedWait() (thanks to
  Stefan Huelswitt).
- VDR no longer gives up if there is no DVB device. It continues to work if
  there is at least one device, either a DVB device found by the core VDR code
  itself, or a device implemented by a plugin.

2002-08-25: Version 1.1.8

- Fixed replaying the last few seconds of a recording.
- Added some missing #includes to files in libdtv for gcc 3.2 (thanks to Jürgen
  Zimmermann).
- Added cDevice::NewOsd() to allow a derived cDevice class to implement its own
  OSD capabilities (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Added cPalette::AllColors() for plugins that need to get the color entries of
  a cPalette (see osdbase.h).
- The new SVDRP command CLRE can be used to clear the entire EPG data (suggested
  by Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- Fixed handling one-shot timers that were already recording and had their start
  time changed into the future (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer for reporting
  this one).

2002-09-08: Version 1.1.9

- Fixed the 'newplugin' script to make it name the target for creating the
  distribution package 'dist', as stated in the PLUGINS.html documentation.
  If you have already created a plugin source directory and Makefile you may
  want to check it and replace the 'package' target with 'dist' if necessary.
- Changed device handling for being able to do simultaneous recording and
  replay on the same device (Time Shifting). In order for this to work you need
  to use a driver with a firmware version that has this feature implemented.
- cDevice::ProvidesCa() is no longer virtual. The new function
  cDevice::ProvidesChannel() is now used to determine whether a device can
  receive a given channel, and by default this function returns false. So a
  device that is a pure replaying device doesn't need to do anything here.
- Increased the recorder buffer size to 5MB in order to be able to better handle
  multiple recordings.
- Implemented cTSBuffer for better handling TS packet buffering in derived
  cDevice classes.
- Changed the interface if cDevice::GetTSPacket() to avoid unnecessary copying
  of data.
- Removed cDevice::Channel(), since this makes no more sense with devices
  receiving multiple channels.
- Switching through channels with the 'Up' and 'Down' keys now skips channels
  that are currently not available (for instance because all devices are
  recording and these channels are on different transponders).
- Implemented an SPU decoder (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Fixed a crash when entering an integer value outside the limits (thanks to
  Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Added play mode pmAudioOnlyBlack (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).

2002-09-15: Version 1.1.10

- Removed a superfluous error message from cLockFile::Unlock() (reported by
  Helmut Auer).
- Fixed starting a recording of the current channel with only one DVB card
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt for his help).
- A previous 'Transfer Mode' is now automatically re-started after a replay
  stops.
- Only calling cStatus::MsgChannelSwitch() if a channel is actually going to
  be switched or has actually been switched successfully (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- The EPG now drops events from "other" streams that have a duration of 86400
  seconds or more (this avoids bogus entries like "PROGRAMMES ALLEMANDS").
- Fixed opening /dev/video in cDvbDevice::GrabImage() in case of NEWSTRUCT
  driver (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Added a missing StripAudioPackets() to cDvbPlayer::Action() (thanks to
  Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added an EPG bugfix for the latest VOX EPG data format.

2002-09-29: Version 1.1.11

- Fixed an incomplete initialization of the filter parameters in eit.c (thanks
  to Jeremy Hall).
- Fixed the 'newplugin' script for use with the NEWSTRUCT driver (thanks to
  Andreas Schultz for reporting this one). If you have already created a plugin
  directory and Makefile with 'newplugin', please apply the following patch to it:

   ### The object files (add further files here):
  -------------------------------------------------------

  This is the diff for the 'setup' example that comes with VDR, so your line
  numbers may be different.
- Added a missing 'public' keyword in device.h (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid).
- Fixed a race condition when starting 'Transfer Mode'.
- Rearranged the remote control key handling to allow plugins to implement
  additional types of remote controls (see PLUGINS.html, section "Remote Control").
  The previously used files 'keys.conf' and 'keys-pc.conf' have been replaced
  by the file 'remote.conf', which holds the key definitions of all remote controls.
- The LIRC remote control keys are now handled just like the keyboard and RCU keys.
  This means that you can use the lircd.conf file as is for your remote control,
  without the need of editing it to make the key names the same as used in VDR.
  When first starting VDR it will go into the "Learning keys" mode and ask you
  to press the various keys. The resulting key assignment will be stored in
  the file 'remote.conf'.
  Since I have no way of testing the LIRC support, I hope I didn't break it in
  the process...
- While learning the remote control keys it is now possible to press the 'Menu'
  key to skip the definition of keys that are not available on your particular
  RC unit.
- Fixed handling DVD subtitles in the SPU decoder (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Avoiding restarts due to 'panic level' when switching channels on the primary
  device during EPG scan.

2002-10-06: Version 1.1.12

- Fixed a missing Flush() call in the remote control learning procedure (thanks
  to Oliver Endriss).
- Modified channel handling to cover all parameters necessary for DVB-C and DVB-T
  (see man vdr(5) for the meaning of the additional parameters stored in the field
  previously named 'polarisation'). Thanks to Uwe Scheffler and Andy Carter for testing.
  If you have a system with different kinds of DVB cards, like DVB-T and DVB-C,
  for instance, there is no more need to distinguish the channels through the
  'Ca' parameter in order to assign them to the various DVB cards. This is now
  taken care of by the "source" parameter. So a channel marked as "terrestrial",
  for example, will only be received on DVB-T cards.
  Note that the cChannel class has been moved into a separate file (channels.[ch]),
  and that all data members have been made private and are now only accessible
  through member functions. You may have to change any plugin code that accesses
  cChannel data accordingly.
- The new configuration file 'sources.conf' contains the various signal sources
  (satellites, cable and terrestrial) which are used in 'channels.conf' and
  'diseqc.conf' (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for adding some satellites to
  'sources.conf' and Oliver Endriss and Lauri Tischler for testing and debugging).
- The 'diseqc' parameter in the channel definitions has been redefined to hold the
  "source" of the given channel (which can be either a satellite, cable or terrestrial).
  For compatibility with channels.conf files from older versions, numeric values in
  this parameter will be tolerated, but they have no meaning. If you want to use
  DiSEqC you will need to replace these old values with the proper source identifiers
  defined in the new configuration file 'sources.conf'. See how this is done in the
  'channels.conf' file that comes with the VDR package.
- The new configuration file 'diseqc.conf' can be used to set up the individual
  diseqc configuration (see man vdr(5) for a description of the file format).
- The "Edit channel" menu has a new entry "Source:" in which the source of this
  channel can be selected (either a satellite, cable or terrestrial). The set of
  parameters at the end of this menu will change according to the type of source.
- The "Use DiSEqC" parameter in the "Setup/LNB" menu has been moved to the beginning
  of the list and disables the rest of the parameters when set to "yes", since these
  are now only meaningful if DiSEqC is _not_ used.
- Removed some unnecessary #includes from eit.c and changed cMenuRecordings::Del()
  to cMenuRecordings::Delete() to avoid warnings in gcc-3.2 (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz for pointing this out).
- Improved skipping channels that are (currently) not available (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Updated channels.conf.terr and channels.conf.cable (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Fixed a bug when pressing the "Blue" button in the main menu without having
  displayed it (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).

2002-10-13: Version 1.1.13

- Added cDevice::DeviceNumber() to get the number of a device, not counting any
  gaps that might be in the index count.
- Fixed fetching the current/next information to handle cases where the duration
  of an event is set wrongly and would last beyond the start time of the next
  event.
- Adapted type names to the new HEAD version of the driver (which the previous
  NEWSTRUCT branch has been merged into). Note that to use this driver version
  you still need to add NEWSTRUCT=1 to the make call when building VDR. You
  need a HEAD version of the LinuxDVB driver dated 2002-10-11 or later to compile
  VDR with NEWSTRUCT=1.
- Fixed radio channels in channels.conf.cable (thanks to Robert Schiele and Uwe
  Scheffler).
- Fixed switching the video format in the Setup/DVB menu (thanks to Uwe Scheffler
  for reporting this one).
- Reactivated full handling of second audio PID (even in 'Transfer Mode').
- Fixed a crash when closing down with remote control plugins (thanks to Oliver
  Endriss helping to debug this one).
- Commands in the file 'commands.conf' can now have a '?' at the end of their
  title, which will result in a confirmation prompt before executing the
  command.
- Changed a few leftover 'new char[...]' to MALLOC(char, ...).
- If a command executed from the "Commands" menu doesn't return any output, the
  OSD will now be closed automatically.
- The SVDRP command PUTE now triggers an immediate write of the 'epg.data' file
  (suggested by Gerhard Steiner).
- The new configuration file 'reccmds.conf' can be used to define commands that
  shall be executed from the "Recordings" menu; see MANUAL and 'man vdr(5)' for
  details (suggested by Gerhard Steiner).

2002-10-27: Version 1.1.14

- Fixed some faulty default parameter initializations (thanks to Robert Schiele).
- Added further satellites to 'sources.conf' (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner
  and Oliver Endriss).
- Updated Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti).
- Fixed a small glitch when switching channels (thanks to Dennis Noordsij for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed handling multiple 'CaCaps' entries in 'setup.conf'.
- Group separators in 'channels.conf' may now be given like ':@201 My Channels',
  where '@201' indicates the number to be given to the next channel. This can be
  used to create 'gaps' in the channel numbering (see 'man 5 vdr'). BE CAREFUL
  TO UPDATE YOUR 'timers.conf' ACCORDINGLY IF INSERTING THIS NEW FEATURE INTO YOUR
  'channels.conf' FILE!
- Timers now internally have a pointer to their channel (this is necessary to
  handle gaps in channel numbers, and in preparation for unique channel ids).
- Fixed slow reaction on SVDRP input (thanks to Guido Fiala for reporting this one).
- Added KI.KA to channels.conf.cable (thanks to Robert Schiele).
- Frequency values for cable and terrestrial channels in 'channels.conf' can
  now be given either in MHz, kHz or Hz. The actual value given will be multiplied
  by 1000 until it is larger than 1000000.
- Fixed skipping unavailable channels when zapping downwards.
- Fixed checking the Ca() status of a cDevice (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed switching audio tracks in 'Transfer Mode' on the primary DVB device
  (thanks to Steffen Barszus and Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one and
  helping to fix it).
- Fixed channel switching in case of an active 'Transfer Mode' on the primary
  device ('Transfer Mode' is now launched with priority '-1').
- Fixed a ternary expression in dvbspu.c.
- Fixed handling 'Transfer Mode' on single device systems when recording an
  encrypted channel (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed blocking replaying in case an encrypted channel is being recorded on
  the primary device.
- Now the name of the remote control is displayed when learning the keys.
- Fixed learning remote control keys in case there is more than one remote
  control (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).
- Implemented additional dedicated keys for "Play", "Pause", "Stop", "Record",
  "FastFwd", "FastRew", "Channel+" and "Channel-". If your remote control supports
  any of these keys you can delete your 'remote.conf' file and restart VDR to
  go through the key learning procedure again in order to assign these new keys.
  See MANUAL for more information.
  Authors of player plugins should update their ProcessKey() functions so that
  the new player keys have the same functionality as the "Up", "Down", "Left",
  "Right" and "Blue" keys, respectively. Note that the existing functionality
  of these keys should by all means be retained, since VDR (and any plugins)
  shall be fully usable with just the basic set of keys. These new keys are only
  for additional comfort in case the remote control in use supports them.
- Implemented new keys to directly access the VDR main menu functions "Schedule",
  "Channels", "Timers", "Recordings", "Setup" and "Commands". If your remote
  control provides keys you want to assign these functions to, you can delete
  your 'remote.conf' file and restart VDR to  go through the key learning procedure
  again in order to assign these new keys. See MANUAL for more information.
- The new configuration file 'keymacros.conf' can be used to assign macros to
  the color buttons in normal viewing mode, as well as to up to 9 user defined
  keys. See MANUAL and man vdr(5) for more information. The default 'keymacros.conf'
  implements the functionality of the "color button patch".
- Fixed a crash when learning the keys of several remote controls and pressing
  buttons of those that have already been learned (thanks to Oliver Endriss for
  reporting this one).

2002-11-03: Version 1.1.15

- Completely switched to the new CVS HEAD version of the linux-dvb driver.
  The NEWSTRUCT compile time switch is now obsolete. The required driver is now
  the CVS HEAD version dated 2002-11-01 or later.
- Adjusted the INSTALL file to the 1.1.x version.
- Only accepting key presses from the current remote control when learning (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed the EPG scanner, which broke 'Transfer Mode' as soon as it kicked in
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling audio tracks in cDvbDevice.
- Updated channels.conf.terr (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Fixed displaying the group separators in the channel display (thanks to Martin
  Hammerschmid for pointing out this one).
- The Makefile now includes the file Make.config (if present in the VDR source
  directory), which allows the user to overwrite several settings with individual
  values (suggested by Andreas Schultz). The VDR distribution archive does not
  contain this file in order to not overwrite a user defined file. There is a
  Make.config.template which contains the default values of the macros the user
  can overwrite.
- Since there have been changes to the 'newplugin' script authors of plugins
  may want to newly create their plugins' Makefiles with the new version of this
  script, and adapt them to their individual needs (make sure you don't overwrite
  your existing plugin directory - make a backup copy first!).
- Fixed reading EPG data via the SVDRP command PUTE (it changed the current
  service ID).
- Fixed closing all dup'ed file descriptors in cPipe.
- Implemented a plugin interface for additional audio processing (see PLUGINS.html
  under "Dolby Digital").
  The functionality of the '-a' command line option has been reactivated.
  Since the author doesn't have any Dolby Digital equipment this may or may not
  work as expected. There may still be some places where a call to cAudios::Clear()
  or cAudios::Mute() is necessary. Those with Dolby Digital equipment should please
  take a look at this and maybe send patches.
  Replaying Dolby Digital in ways other than through VDR's '-a' option will have to
  be implemented as plugins. Those who have written patches for VDR version 1.0.x
  should convert their work into the proper plugins for version 1.1.x.
  Note to authors of cPlayer derived plugins: please read the modified comments
  in device.h regarding the member functions cDevice::Clear(), cDevice::Mute() and
  cDevice::PlayAudio(). Derived classes must call these base class member functions
  to make sure all registered cAudio objects are properly handled. Also note that
  the return type of cDevice::PlayAudio() has been changed to 'void', since this
  function always has to accept the entire data block immediately and there is
  nothing that could be reasonably done in case an error occurs in one of the
  cAudio objects.
- Now checking the driver's DVB_API_VERSION in dvbdevice.h. Since VDR now requires
  a driver dated 2002-11-01 or later the MIN_DVB_DRIVER_VERSION_FOR_TIMESHIFT and
  DVB_DRIVER_VERSION stuff has been replaced with DO_REC_AND_PLAY_ON_PRIMARY_DEVICE,
  which can be used to disable simultaneous recording and replaying on the primary
  DVB device in case there are problems with this.

2002-11-10: Version 1.1.16

- Fixed saving the polarization parameter of channels that have a number in the
  'source' parameter (thanks to Peter Seyringer for reporting this one).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' (thanks to Andy Carter).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Achim Lange).
- First step towards a "unique channel ID". The channel ID is a human readable
  string, made up from several parameters of the channel's definition in the file
  'channels.conf' (see man vdr(5) for details).
  In order for the "unique channel ID" to work, all channel definitions now must
  be unique with respect to the combination of their Source, Frequency and SID
  parameters. You may have to fix your 'channels.conf' manually if there are error
  messages in the log file when loading it. BE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR
  'channels.conf' AND 'timers.conf' FILE BEFORE SWITCHING TO THIS VERSION, AND CHECK
  VERY CAREFULLY WHETHER YOUR TIMERS ARE STILL SET TO THE RIGHT CHANNELS!
  When reading an existing 'timers.conf', the channels will be identified as before
  by their numbers. As soon as this file is written back, the channel numbers will
  be replaced by the channel IDs. After that it is possible to manually edit the
  'channels.conf' file and rearrange the channels without breaking the timers.
  Note that you can still define new timers manually by using the channel number.
  VDR will correctly identify the 'channel' parameter in a timer definition and
  use it as a channel number or a channel ID, respectively. Also, the SVDRP commands
  that return timer definitions will list them with channel numbers in order to
  stay compatible with existing applications.
  The channel ID is also used in the 'epg.data' file to allow EPG information from
  different sources to be stored, which would previously have been mixed up in case
  they were using the same 'service ID'. Note that the contents of an existing
  'epg.data' file from a previous version will be silently ignored, since it doesn't
  contain the new channel IDs. When inserting EPG data into VDR via SVDRP you now also
  need to use the channel IDs.
  Currently the EPG data received from the DVB data stream only uses the 'Source'
  and 'Service ID' part of the channel ID. This makes it work for channels with
  the same service IDs on different sources (like satellites, cable or terrestrial).
  However, it doesn't work yet if the service IDs are not unique within a specific
  source. This will be fixed later.
- Added missing SID parameters to 'channels.conf'. Some channels have been removed
  since they are apparently no longer broadcasted.
- Removed dropping EPG events from "other" streams that have a duration of 86400
  seconds or more (was introduced in version 1.1.10). This has become obsolete by
  the modification in version 1.1.13, which fixed fetching the current/next information
  to handle cases where the duration of an event is set wrongly and would last beyond
  the start time of the next event. Besides, the change in 1.1.10 broke handling EPG
  data for NVOD channels.
- Fixed a compiler warning regarding cMenuChannels::Del() and MenuTimers::Del() hiding
  the base class virtual functions.

2002-11-24: Version 1.1.17

- Added new entries to 'ca.conf'.
- Fixed closing unused PID handles (thanks to Stefan Schluenss for reporting this
  one).
- Added more examples to 'diseqc.conf' (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed disabling multiple recordings on a single DVB card (comment out the definition
  of the macros DO_REC_AND_PLAY_ON_PRIMARY_DEVICE and DO_MULTIPLE_RECORDINGS in
  dvbdevice.c).
- Plugins can now have their very own OSD setup in the object they return from
  a call to cPlugin::MainMenuAction(). In order to implement this, the return type
  of cPlugin::MainMenuAction() had to be changed from (cOsdMenu *) to (cOsdObject *).
  So in case you are compiling an existing plugin with this version of VDR and you
  get an error message, simply change cOsdMenu to cOsdObject in the plugin's source
  for the MainMenuAction() function.
  Plugin authors who have so far (ab)used the cControl mechanism to implement their
  own raw OSD should take a look at the new demo plugin 'osddemo'. It implements
  a very primitive game that shows how a plugin can have its own raw OSD. Especially
  look into cLineGame and see how it implements the Show() function. See also
  the chapter on "User interaction" in PLUGINS.html.
- Added three new fields to the lines in 'channels.conf': NID, TID and RID. NID and
  TID are the Network and Transport Stream IDs, respectively. RID is an additional ID
  that can be used to tell apart channels that would otherwise be indistinguishable.
  This is typically the case with radio channels, which may have the same NID, TID
  and SID, but different "radio IDs". This new field is therefore called RID ("radio
  ID"). Currently NID and TID are not yet used by VDR and should always be 0. The
  RID is actually used when building the "unique channel ID", so if you have channels
  in your 'channels.conf' file that cause error messages when loading, you can set
  the RIDs of these channels to different values.
  When reading an old 'channels.conf' these new fields will be automatically
  initialized to 0 and once the file is written back to disk they will be appended
  to the channel definitions.
  Thanks to Régis Bossut for pointing out that with some providers the channels can
  only be distinguished through the RID.
- The "unique channel ID" now contains an optional 5th part (the RID). See man vdr(5).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' and made some channels unique using the new RID
  (thanks to Andreas Kool for pointing out the problems).
- Made some channels unique in 'channels.conf.terr' using the new RID.
- Extended the '-l' option to allow logging to LOG_LOCALn (n=0..7) by writing, for
  instance, '-l 3.7' (suggested by Jürgen Schmidt).
- Now deleting stale lock files if they have a time stamp that is outside the window
  'now +/- LOCKFILESTALETIME'. This improves things in cases where the system time
  makes far jumps, so that a lock file might end up with a time stamp that lies
  in the distant future (thanks to Oliver Endriss).

2002-12-01: Version 1.1.18

- Fixed missing initialization of 'number' in cChannel (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed a misplaced ')' in the fix about the stale lock files (thanks again to
  Oliver Endriss for pointing this out - it was my fault).
- Group delimiters in the 'channels.conf' file that have no text (like a simple ":"
  or ":@201") no longer show up in the Channels menu (suggested by Guy Roussin).
- Added "Tele 5" to 'channels.conf' (thanks to Georg Hitsch).
- Changed the source directory name for plugins from 'SRC' to 'src' (suggested by
  Clemens Kirchgatterer).
- Removed transponders 10788, 11739 and 12266 from 'channels.conf' (apparently they
  are no longer active).
- Deactivated some templates in tools.h in case some plugin needs to use the STL
  (suggested by Gerald Berwolf).
- Timers now accept channel IDs even if the 'source' is 0 (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt
  for reporting this one).
- Now taking an active SVDRP connection into account when doing shutdown or
  housekeeping (suggested by Emil Naepflein).
- Macros in 'keymacros.conf' can now use "@plugin" to directly access the main menu
  function of a given plugin (see man vdr(5) for details).
- The new plugin 'sky' can be used to integrate a Sky Digibox into the VDR system,
  using a Kfir MPEG2 encoder card (see PLUGINS/src/sky/README for details).

2002-12-08: Version 1.1.19

- The character '|' in description texts of EPG records is now interpreted as a
  newline character (suggested by Gerhard Steiner).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Andreas Kool).
- Improved handling of repeated remote keys.
- The RCU now only sets the channel number display when there are no incoming remote
  control keys, which improves reaction on repeated keys.
- The actual tuning is now done in a separate thread, which makes zapping through the
  channels a lot faster and no longer gets stuck on channels that don't broadcast.
  This also makes "Motor-DiSEqC" work (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for his help
  in testing this). Since switching channels now no longer explicitly waits for a
  channel lock in the foreground thread, the "panic level" mechanism is no longer
  used (maybe we don't need it any more, anyway).
- The keyboard is now by default always active to control VDR. The 'make' option
  REMOTE=KBD is therefore obsolete. When compiling VDR with REMOTE=RCU or REMOTE=LIRC,
  the keyboard can thus now be active together with the remote control. If you want
  to build VDR _without_ keyboard support you can set NO_KBD=1 in the 'make' call.
  Since the keyboard codes are now different from the ones used previously (which
  were mapped by the 'ncurses' library) you will need to go through the "Learning
  keys" procedure again. To do so, either delete the file /video/remote.conf or
  remove the KBD.* entries from it before starting this version of VDR.
  (Thanks to Thomas Sailer for pointing out how to set the terminal parameters to
  read from the keyboard).
- The 'ncurses' library is now only necessary when compiling VDR with DEBUG_OSD=1.

2002-12-15: Version 1.1.20

- Now checking if there is a connection to the keyboard (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti)
  and only creating the KBD remote control if VDR is running in the foreground.
- Fixed taking an active SVDRP connection into account when doing shutdown (thanks
  to Gregoire Favre for reporting this one).
- Changed setting of CXX and CXXFLAGS variables in Makefile, so that an externally
  defined value will be taken if present (suggested by Robert Schiele).
  Plugin authors should please change the lines

  CXX      = g++
  CXXFLAGS = -O2 -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual

  in their Makefile to

  CXX      ?= g++
  CXXFLAGS ?= -O2 -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual

- Fixed recording overlapping timers on the same channel in case
  DO_REC_AND_PLAY_ON_PRIMARY_DEVICE and/or DO_MULTIPLE_RECORDINGS is not defined
  (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti).
- No longer stopping/restarting the DMX when switching audio channels (thanks to
  Sven Goethel).
- Fixed high CPU load in 'Transfer Mode' (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- If a PC keyboard is used as remote control, the string entry fields in the
  menus now accept character input directly (however, this works only for keys that
  are not otherwise defined as remote control keys). Also, plugins can switch the
  cKbdRemote class into "raw mode", where all keyboard input will be made available
  through the new 'kKbd' key code and none of it will be processed as normal remote
  control functions (thanks to Jan Rieger for suggestions and testing).
- Fixed deleting characters in string entry fields in 'insert' mode.
- Now using "Doxygen" to generate source documentation (thanks to Walter Stroebel
  for providing an initial 'Doxyfile' configuration and adjusting some comments).
  See INSTALL for information how to do this. Some function descriptions have
  already been adapted to Doxygen, more will follow.

2003-01-10: Version 1.1.21

- Fixed the 'channels.conf' entries for "Studio Universal" and "Disney Channel".
- Fixed handling channels in the "Channels" menu in case there are ':@nnn' group
  separators without names (thanks to Guy Roussin for reporting this one).
- The SVDRP command CHAN now also accepts channel IDs.
- Increased the timeout until an index file is considered no longer to be written
  (sometimes in time shift with heavy system load the index file was closed too
  early by the replay thread).
- Implemented "Link Layer" based CAM support, which hopefully will solve the
  problems with CAMs we had in the past. To use this you need the driver version
  2002-01-08 or higher (with the new firmware supporting the "Link Layer" protocol).
- Added an EPG bugfix that moves the Subtitle data to the Extended Description in
  case the latter is empty and the Subtitle exceeds some useful length.
- Since several channels put very long strings into the Subtitle part of their
  EPG data, that string is now limited in length when used in a recording's
  file name.

2003-01-26: Version 1.1.22

- Added 'Hrvatska radiotelevizija' and 'RTV Slovenija' to ca.conf (thanks to
  Paul Gohn).
- Implemented actual user input for CAM enquiry menus.
- Since disk file systems apparently don't honor the O_NONBLOCK flag to read from
  a file in non-blocking mode the cDvbPlayer now uses a non blocking file reader
  class to make sure replay remains smooth even under heavy system load.
- Increased the maximum possible packet size in remux.c to avoid corrupted streams
  with broadcasters that send extremely large PES packets (thanks to Teemu Rantanen).
- Added TS error checking to remux.c (thanks to Teemu Rantanen).
- Modified cRingBufferLinear to avoid excessive memmove() calls in 'Transfer Mode'
  and during recordings, which dramatically reduces CPU load. Thanks to Teemu
  Rantanen for pinpointing the problem with the excessive memmove() calls.
- Updated 'channels.conf' (thanks to Achim Lange).
- Added/improved Swedish language texts (thanks to Jan Ekholm).
- Fixed the description of the "Scroll pages" OSD setup parameter ('yes' and 'no'
  were mixed up).
- Fixed handling the LOG_LOCALn parameters in the -l option (thanks to Dimitrios
  Dimitrakos).
- Changed EIT processing to always read a full section.
- Fixed handling user defined CFLAGS in libdtv/libvdr/Makefile (thanks to Clemens
  Kirchgatterer and Robert Schiele).
- Fixed skipping unavailable channels in the EPG scanner.

2003-02-02: Version 1.1.23

- Fixed a new/delete malloc/free mismatch in ringbuffer.c (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Improved CAM handling.

2003-02-09: Version 1.1.24

- Improved CAM handling (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for a great deal of help
  in debugging this). It is now possible to insert the CAM in any of the two slots,
  to insert and remove it while VDR is running and even to have two CAMs inserted.
- Turning SI filtering off and on when switching channels.
- Timers are now processed even if an OSD menu is open (except for menus that
  explicitly handle timers).

2003-02-16: Version 1.1.25

- Fixed high CPU load during replay (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for pointing out this
  one).
- Fixed margin handling in cRingBufferLinear.
- Now polling the output device in 'Transfer Mode' and retrying to put packets
  into the ring buffer.
- Resetting the CAM slot in case communication breaks down.
- Improved keyboard detection (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' (thanks to Andy Carter).
- Fixed broken support for raw OSDs of plugins (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for
  reporting this one).
- Broken CAM connections are now restored automatically.

2003-03-19: Version 1.1.26

- Removed signal handling and usleep(5000) from cDvbOsd::Cmd() (apparently this
  is no longer necessary with DVB driver 1.0.0pre2 or later).
- If the primary device (as defined in setup.conf) doesn't have an MPEG decoder
  (and thus can't be used as a primary device) VDR now scans all devices at
  startup and uses the first one (if any) that actually has an MPEG decoder.
  That way this will also work automatically if the primary device is implemented
  by a plugin.
- Fixed a possible deadlock when using the "Blue" button in the "Schedules" menu
  to switch to an other channel (thanks to Torsten Herz).
- Fixed the EPG bugfix code number for the MAX_USEFUL_SUBTITLE_LENGTH fix (thanks to
  Torsten Herz for reporting this one).
- Modified the EPG scanner to avoid CPU load peaks (thanks to Steffen Becker for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed support for Viaccess CAMs (thanks to Axel Gruber for helping to debug this).

2003-04-13: Version 1.1.27

- The CAM is now accessed only if the current channel actually has a non-zero Ca
  value, and CAM access is completely suppressed during replay, which avoids
  problems in case the CAM is attached to the primary DVB device.
- The "Left" and "Right" buttons now set the cursor to the first or last list item
  even if the list consist only of a single page, like, for instance, the Main menu
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Made the log message "OSD window width must be a multiple of 4..." a debug message
  instead of an error message, so it can be avoided by using a log level less than 3.
- Updated Greek language texts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Fixed faulty behaviour of the "Mute" key in case the channel display is visible
  (thanks to Florian Bartels for reporting this one and Sascha Volkenandt for
  helping to fix it).
- Modified LOF handling to allow for C-band reception (thanks to Malcolm Caldwell).
- Added some missing cAudio handling calls (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Replaced the 'for' loops in StripAudioPackets() with memset() calls (thanks to
  Werner Fink).
- Further increased the timeout until an index file is considered no longer to be
  written.
- Fixed a crash in case the index file can't be accessed any more during replay
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Fixed displaying messages in the status line in case they exceed the OSD width
  (thanks to Gerhard Steiner for reporting this one).
- Avoiding high CPU load in case the connection to LIRC gets lost (thanks to
  Ludwig Nussel).
- Fixed handling repeat function with LIRC (thanks to Ludwig Nussel).
- Fixed handling min/max borders when entering integer values (thanks to Andy
  Grobb for reporting this one).
- Implemented a "resume ID" which allows several users to each have their own
  resume.vdr files (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid). This parameter can be set in
  the "Setup/Replay" menu (see MANUAL for details).
- Now using 'libdtv' version 0.0.5 (thanks to Rolf Hakenes for the new version
  and Stefan Huelswitt for adapting VDR to it).
- If no device with an MPEG decoder can be found at startup, the first device
  is now used as primary device (just to have some device).
- Adjusted some Premiere channels in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Thomas Koch).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Stefan Hußfeldt).
- The 'epg.data' file is now read after all plugins have been started (thanks
  to Sascha Volkenandt).
- The LIRC remote control no longer tries to learn keys if it can't connect to
  the LIRC daemon (thanks to Ludwig Nussel for reporting this one). The same
  applies to the RCU remote control in case of errors during startup.
- Fixed handling of Ca parameters with values <= MAXDEVICES, which don't indicate
  an actual encrypted channel (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).

2003-04-21: Version 1.1.28

- Using masks in EIT filtering to reduce the number of filters (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz).
- Fixed handling Ca descriptors (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Now only those Ca descriptors are sent to a CAM that are actually understood
  by that CAM.
- Re-enabled CAM communication during replay and on non-Ca channels. This requires
  a DVB driver with firmware version 2613 or later.
- It is now possible to do simultaneous recording and replay with a single DVB
  card, even with encrypted channels. This requires the use of the Link Layer
  firmware, version 2613 or higher; the -icam firmware is still limited to live
  encrypted channels only. Finally we have time shift for encrypted channels on
  single card systems!
- Enhanced detection of pending user I/O from CAMs to avoid sluggish reaction
  to remote control keypresses.
- Implemented "pause live video". You can now press "Menu/Yellow" or "Pause" on
  your remote control while watching live video to start an instant recording
  of the current programme and immediately start replaying that recording.

2003-04-27: Version 1.1.29

- Fixed detecting broken connection to the LIRC daemon (thanks to Ludwig Nussel).
- Now sending CA descriptors to the CAM in the same sequence as they were originally
  received (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- The PCR PID can now be set separately from the video PID. The syntax in the
  'channels.conf' file is, for example, ...:164+17:..., where 164 is the video PID
  and 17 is the PCR PID. The separator is a '+' sign, not a comma or semicolon as
  with the audio PIDs, because this is not an alternate PID, but rather an
  additional, necessary PID. In order to use this feature you need a driver version
  dated 2003-04-27 or higher (setting the PCR PID didn't work in earlier versions).
- Fixed deleting the last recording in the "Recordings" menu, which started pausing
  live video (thanks to Christoph Friederich for reporting this one).
- Now setting the "broken link" flag for GOPs at the beginning of a new video
  sequence, which avoids artifacts when cutting (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Removed the Mute() call from cDvbDevice::StillPicture() (suggested by Andreas
  Schultz).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Berlin (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Extended logging info when starting/stopping timers to show the channel number,
  start/stop time and the file name (suggested by Manuel Hartl).
- Added a note regarding non-VDR files in the /videoX directories to INSTALL
  (suggested by Benjamin Harling).
- Skipping keys that come in too fast from LIRC (thanks to Christian Jacobsen).
- Avoiding short display of the main menu if a plugin displays its own OSD and
  is started through a user defined key macro (thanks to Andreas Mair for reporting
  this one).
- Reduced the time to wait for EPG data when starting a recording to 3 seconds.
- The new SVDRP command STAT can be used to request information about the disk
  usage (thanks to Thomas Koch).
- Fixed faulty calculation of section length in eit.c (thanks to Teemu Rantanen).

2003-05-04: Version 1.1.30

- Fixed minimum lifespan of deleted recordings (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti).
- Updated French OSD texts (thanks to Olivier Jacques).
- Fixed paging through lists with repeated Left/Right keys.
- Fixed setting the PCR-PID in case it is equal to one of the other PIDs (thanks
  to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).
- Fixed double call to MainMenuAction() of a plugin if invoked via a hotkey (thanks
  to Kai Moeller for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling dedicated keys.
- Now turning off live PIDs when replaying. This avoids short spikes from other
  channels when switching between Transfer Mode channels, and also lets an ongoing
  replay continue even if a recording is started on the primary device.
- The RCU channel display no longer changes when a recording on a different
  channel starts on the primary device.
- Restoring the current channel in case a recording has switched the transponder.
  If all devices are busy and none of them can provide the current channel, the
  message "Channel not available!" will be displayed.
- Removed the (no longer necessary) 'panic' stuff from cThread.
- Added cStatus::OsdItem() to provide the entire list of menu items to a plugin
  (thanks to Carsten Siebholz).
- The red ("Record") and yellow ("Pause") button in the "Main" menu are no longer
  available when replaying.

2003-05-11: Version 1.1.31

- Introduced the new function cPlugin::Initialize(), in order to be able to separate
  the startup of a plugin into an "early" (Initialize()) and "late" (Start()) phase
  (suggested by Andreas Schultz). Plugin authors should please read the section
  about "Getting started" in PLUGINS.html and adapt their code if applicable.
- Implemented the CableDeliverySystemDescriptor and TerrestrialDeliverySystemDescriptor
  in libdtv (thanks to Sven Grothklags and Andreas Schultz).
- Fixed keeping live video active in case the primary device doesn't have an MPEG
  decoder (thanks to Wolfgang Goeller for reporting this one).
- Implemented cDevice::ActualDevice(), which returns the actual receiving device in
  case of 'Transfer Mode', or the primary device otherwise. This may be useful for
  plugins that want to attach a cReceiver to the device where the current live video
  is actually coming from.
- Added VDRVERSNUM to config.h, which can be used by the preprocessor to check the
  actual VDR version (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Removed the WaitForPut/WaitForGet stuff from cRingBuffer, since it appears to
  no longer be necessary due to the implementation of cNonBlockingFileReader in
  dvbplayer.c. Also, the long timeout in WaitForPut caused problems with cReceivers
  that use a ring buffer and didn't immediately return from their Receive() function
  if the buffer runs full (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling EPG data where the "extended event descriptor" comes before the
  "short event" or a "time shifted event" (thanks to Jonan Santiago).
- Disabled the "Received stuffing section in EIT" log message.
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Berlin (thanks to Juri Haberland).
- Avoiding short display of the "Main" menu when pressing the "Recordings" button
  or the "Back" button during replay.
- Further increased the timeout until an index file is considered no longer to be
  written.
- Implemented separate PausePriority and PauseLifetime parameters for the recordings
  created when pausing live video (suggested by Alfred Zastrow).
- Changed C++ style comments in libdtv into C style to avoid warnings in gcc 3.x
  (thanks to Andreas Schultz).

2003-05-18: Version 1.1.32

- Removed a faulty parameter initialization in menu.c (thanks to Lauri Tischler for
  reporting this one).
- Re-implemented the WaitForPut/WaitForGet stuff in cRingBuffer, since some plugins
  actually need this. By default the buffer does not wait; if a plugin needs the
  waiting functionality it can call the new SetTimeouts() function.
- Moved the call to cPlugin::Start() further up in vdr.c, to make sure it gets
  called before trying to learn the keys (problem reported by Oliver Endriss).
- No longer starting the editing process if no marks have been set (thanks to
  Matthias Raus for reporting this one).
- Added Catalan language texts (thanks to Marc Rovira Vall and Ramon Roca).
  Plugin authors may want to add the new entries to their I18N texts and contact
  the translators to have their texts translated. Note that there are now 16
  different OSD languages, so please make sure you have 16 versions for each of
  your texts.
- Moved the detection of a broken video data stream from the cDevice into the
  cRecorder to avoid problems with cReceivers that want to receive from PIDs
  that are currently not transmitting (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for reporting
  this one).
- Fixed setting the locking pid after a timed wait (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Avoiding spurious section filter settings after a channel switch.
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Stefan Hußfeldt).
- Fixed reading 'epg.data' for channels with non-zero RID (thanks to Oliver
  Endriss for reporting this one).
- Fixed EPG bugfix statistics to avoid log entries for undefined channels (thanks
  to Lars Bläser for reporting this one).
- No longer waiting inside cIndexFile::CatchUp() to avoid shortly blocking replay
  at the end of a recording.

2003-05-25: Version 1.1.33

- Modified handling of audio packets in cDvbPlayer for better sync with external
  AC3 replay (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Fixed a memory leak in cNonBlockingFileReader (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Completed the French OSD texts (thanks to Gregoire Favre).
- Completed the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Niko Tarnanen and Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed I/O handling in case an explicit controlling terminal is given (thanks
  to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed resume file handling in case the resume.vdr file can't be written
  (thanks to Gerhard Steiner).
- Fixed cutting a recording if there is only a single editing mark (thanks to
  Ralf Klueber for reporting this one).
- Fixed volume display in case a plugin has its own OSD open (thanks to Marcel
  Wiesweg).
- Fixed channel switching in the EPG scanner on single device systems.
- Completed the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).
- Now switching to the channel used by the most recently started timer in case
  the original current channel becomes unavailable due to a recording on a
  different transponder. If this fails, a channel up/down switch is attempted as
  a fallback solution (thanks to Lauri Tischler for reporting this one, and to
  Hermann Gausterer for suggesting to switch to the recording channel).
- Fixed cReplayControl::Show() to avoid a compiler warning in g++ 3.2.3 (thanks
  to Jan Ekholm for reporting this one).
- Completed the Slovenian OSD texts (thanks to Matjaz Thaler).
- Changed the DEFAULTPRIORITY in device.c to -1, so that the primary device
  will be used for FTA recordings in case the CAM is connected to a non-primary
  device (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for reporting this one).
- The cCiHandler now closes its file handle when it gets destroyed.
- Checking for duplicate recordings with the same file name and disabling the
  second timer (thanks to Peter Bieringer for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling newly created timers in case they are not confirmed with "Ok"
  (thanks to Gerhard Steiner for reporting this one).
- It is now possible to directly delete a timer that is currently recording
  (thanks to Alexander Damhuis for reporting this one).

2003-05-30: Version 1.2.0pre1

- Some corrections to the French OSD texts (thanks to Olivier Jacques).
- Fixed some missing commas in i18n.c (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos for
  reporting this problem).
- Some corrections to the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Niko Tarnanen and Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Completed the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Antonio Ospite).
- Fixed breaking off replay in case the user hits "Play" or "Pause" too soon after
  going into "Pause live video" mode (thanks to Karim Afifi for reporting this one).
- Some corrections to the Catalan OSD texts (thanks to Jordi Vilà).
- Single event timers are now deleted if the recording they are doing is
  deleted before the timer ends.
- Fixed an uninitialized variable in cDisplayChannel (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed a possible access of invalid file handles in cSIProcessor::Action()
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).

2003-06-01: Version 1.2.0

- Completed Greek language texts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Completed Polish language texts (thanks to Michael Rakowski).
- Added a note about NPTL ("Native Posix Thread Library") to the INSTALL file
  (thanks to Jon Burgess for pointing this out).

- Officially released as version 1.2.0.

2003-06-09: Version 1.2.1

- Fixed OSD access in case none of the devices provides one (thanks to Axel
  Gruber for reporting this one).
- Fixed editing channels ('timers.conf' was not written after a channel has
  been modified, which could result in errors upon the next start of VDR).
- Fixed a crash when canceling a newly created timer (thanks to Thomas Schmidt
  for reporting this one).
- Completed Hungarian language texts (thanks to Istvan Koenigsberger and Guido
  Josten).
- Fixed device handling in the CICAM menu in case a VDR instance was started
  with a specific device using the -D option (thanks to Gerald Raaf for reporting
  this one).
- Initializing the current channel to '1' to avoid a crash in creating a new
  timer in case there is no device in the system that can actually receive any
  channel (thanks to Malcolm Caldwell for reporting this one).
- Some corrections to the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Niko Tarnanen and Rolf
  Ahrenberg).

2003-08-03: Version 1.2.2

- Fixed a bug in channel switching after Left/Right has been pressed (thanks to
  Michael Walle for reporting this one).
- Improved channel switching in case of numerical input by switching as soon as
  the channel is unique (suggested by Jaakko Hyvätti).
- Fixed creating a new channel in the "Channels" menu in case the 'channels.conf'
  contains ':@nnn' lines with no text (thanks to Guy Roussin for reporting this
  one).
- Changed the behaviour of the '0' key in normal viewing mode so that a channel
  only qualifies as "previous" if it has been selected for at least 3 seconds
  (suggested by Thomas Keil).
- Now clearing the channel info display when entering numeric keys to switch
  channels (suggested by Guy Roussin).
- Added missing I18N entry for "Ppid" (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling the color buttons in the "Edit channel" menu (thanks to Thomas
  Keil for reporting this one).
- Fixed an occasional "Broken pipe" error in SVDRP connections (thanks to Gerhard
  Steiner for reporting this one).
- Fixed checking CA capabilities with the dvb-kernel driver (thanks to Kenneth
  Aafløy).
- Fixed selecting the device, because sometimes an FTA recording terminated a
  CA recording (thanks to Emil Naepflein).
- Fixed a possible crash in case a VFAT file system is used without compiling VDR
  with VFAT=1 (thanks to Ernst Fürst for reporting this one).
- Now the program uses the values of VIDEODIR and PLUGINDIR defined in Makefile
  or Make.config as defaults (thanks to Steffen Barszus).
- Added the usual menu timeout to the CAM menus.

2003-08-17: Version 1.2.3 (not officially released)

- Fixed the TS to PES repacker so that it works with MPEG1 streams (thanks to
  Andreas Kool).
- Fixed keeping track of the current channel number when moving channels in
  the "Channels" menu (thanks to Mirko Günther for reporting this one).
- Made the plugin library directory configurable via Make.config (thanks to
  Ludwig Nussel).
- Fixed scaling SPU bitmaps in Letterbox mode when playing NTSC material.
  In order to do this, the cDevice was given a new member function GetVideoSystem().
- Fixed two warnings when compiling with gcc 3.3.1 (thanks to Alfred Zastrow for
  reporting this).
- Made crc32() a static function in libdtv/libsi/si_parser.c to avoid a name clash
  when using other libraries that also implement a function by that name (thanks
  to Reinhard Nissl for reporting this one).
- Fixed staying off the end of an ongoing recording while replaying in time shift
  mode (thanks to Rainer Zocholl for reporting this one).
- VDR now stops with exit status 2 if one of the configuration files can't be
  read correctly at program startup (suggested by Rainer Zocholl).
- Fixed a crash when starting "Pause live video" twice within the same minute on
  the same channel.
- Fixed freezing replay if a timer starts while in Transfer Mode from the device
  used by the timer, and the timer needs a different transponder (thanks to
  Richard Robson for reporting this one).
- Fixed toggling channels with the '0' key (thanks to Mirko Günther for reporting
  this one).
- Made the "Zap timeout" (the time until a channel counts as "previous" for
  switching with '0') a setup variable, available in "Setup/Miscellaneous"
  (suggested by Helmut Auer).
- Removing deleted recordings faster than normal when cutting, to avoid running
  out of disk space (thanks to Manfred Schmidt-Voigt for reporting this one).

2003-08-26: Version 1.2.4 (not officially released)

- Fixed 'runvdr' to stay in the loop only if VDR returns an exit status of '1'.
- Completed the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Empty values in setup.conf are no longer treated as an error (thanks to Andreas
  Kool for reporting this one).
- Added a note about the config files of plugins to INSTALL (thanks to Thomas
  Keil).
- VDR now continues to start up, even if there is an error in setup.conf.
- Fixed a bug in resetting OSD color palettes (thanks to Torsten Herz).
- Fixed starting a recording on the primary device if there is a replay session
  active (thanks to Javier Marcet for reporting this one).
- Avoiding an unnecessary stop of an ongoing Transfer Mode when starting a
  recording on the primary device.

2003-08-31: Version 1.2.5pre1

- Now explicitly handling exit value 0 and 2 in 'runvdr'.
- Added a missing 'w' to the allowed characters for Finnish and Swedish (thanks
  to Lauri Tischler and Ragnar Sundblad).
- Added channels for DVB-T Hannover (Germany) to channels.conf.terr (thanks to
  Peter Waechtler).
- Fixed a hangup in SVDRP when the client disappears without sending QUIT (thanks
  to Robert Bartl for reporting this one). The problem was introduced in version
  1.2.2 through the fix for an occasional "Broken pipe" error in SVDRP connections.
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Berlin.
- Fixed displaying still pictures, now using the driver's VIDEO_STILLPICTURE call
  directly (thanks to Oliver Endriss). This also improves navigating through DVD
  menus with the DVD plugin. If this causes problems with your particular system
  (maybe because you are using the 'analogtv' plugin) you can reactivate the
  previous behaviour by commenting out the line
  #define VIDEO_STILLPICTURE_WORKS_WITH_VDR_FRAMES
  in VDR/dvbdevice.c.
  Note that you need driver version 2003-08-23 or later for this to work!
- Fixed handling extra blanks in plugin command lines.
- Actually implemented the SVDRP command DELC.
- Now clearing the player device if there are too many poll timeouts in 'Transfer
  Mode', which avoids buffer overflows and black screens in such cases.

2003-09-07: Version 1.2.5pre2

- Updated VIVA, VIVA Plus, MTV Central and MTV 2 in channels.conf (thanks to
  Sebastian Frei).
- Changed "Studio Universal" to "Sci-Fi" in channels.conf.
- Fixed a crash when using the --terminal option without having access to the
  given terminal (thanks to Steffen Barszus for helping to debug this one).
- Added a note about the driver version needed for the still picture fix from
  version 1.2.5pre1 to work properly (thanks to Oliver Endriss for pointing
  this out).
- Fixed setting the primary device in case none of the devices provides an MPEG
  decoder (thanks to Rene Bartsch for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling the "Red" button in the "Schedules" menu in case there are no
  events listed for a particular channel (thanks to Christoph Hermanns for
  reporting this one).
- When setting an editing mark while in "Pause" mode, replay now immediately
  jumps to the marked frame (thanks to Oskar Signell for pointing out this
  problem).
- The DVB devices no longer send CA descriptors to the CAM while the EPG scanner
  is active (sometimes the CAMs got irritated when the device tuned to channels
  they couldn't handle).

2003-09-14: Version 1.2.5pre3

- Fixed dropping out of replay mode while viewing a recording that is still
  going on (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting and helping to debug this
  one).
- Fixed handling ':' characters in channel names when reading channels.conf
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl for reporting this one).
- Fixed the URL to the 'Doxygen' tool in INSTALL (thanks to Dirk Essl).
- Removed the obsolete chapter "Stopping a recording on the primary DVB interface"
  from MANUAL.
- Completed Dutch language texts (thanks to Hans Dingemans).
- Made 'diseqc.conf' a required file only if Setup.DiSEqC is activated (thanks to
  Thomas Schmidt).
- VDR now starts up even if 'keymacros.conf' references a plugin that is currently
  not loaded (suggested by Alexander Wetzel).
- Fixed checking for VIDEO_STREAM_S in cRemux::SetBrokenLink() (thanks to Oliver
  Endriss).
- Added 'repeat' function to keys '7' and '9' ("jump to mark") in replay mode
  (suggested by Oliver Endriss).
- Made cOsdMenu::Display() virtual, which allows plugins to do some additional
  processing after calling the base class function (suggested by Jan Rieger).
- Updated 'ca.conf' (thanks to Marco Franceschetti).

2003-09-17: Version 1.2.5

- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Stefan Hußfeldt).

2003-10-17: Version 1.2.6pre1

- Updated the required driver version in INSTALL (thanks to Jens Groth for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed missing channel info after an incomplete channel group switch (thanks
  to Andreas Trauer).
- Fixed handling a channels.conf that contains a ":@nnn" line as its last entry
  (thanks to Ralf Klueber).
- Fixed detecting the /dev/videoN devices for GRAB in case there are others
  before the DVB devices (thanks to Andreas Kool).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Berlin (thanks to Markus Hardt).
- Fixed handling rc key learning in case cRemote::Initialize() returns 'false'
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed initializing the highlight area in cDvbSpuDecoder (thanks to Sven Goethel).
- Now trying to get a timer's channel without RID when loading 'timers.conf'
  (thanks to Thomas Rausch).
- Removed the unused 0x73 (TOT) filter in eit.c (thanks to Andreas Trauer).
- Fixed extracting the ES data in cDvbDevice::StillPicture() (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Added MPEG1 handling to cDvbDevice::StillPicture() (thanks to Thomas
  Heiligenmann).
- Changed the default "Lifetime" to 99, which means that recordings will
  never be deleted automatically in case the disk runs full (suggested by
  Oliver Endriss). Note that in an existing VDR installation the current
  value as set in 'setup.conf' will still be used - this change only affects
  new VDR installations.
- Edited recordings will now never be deleted automatically if the disk runs
  full (suggested by Emil Naepflein).
- Channel IDs are now checked when reading 'channels.conf' to avoid later
  problems with timers.

2003-10-19: Version 1.2.6pre2

- Improved cDvbDevice::StillPicture() (thanks to Thomas Heiligenmann).

2003-10-24: Version 1.2.6pre3

- Improved cDvbDevice::StillPicture() (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Continuing learning remote control keys in case one rc fails (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed handling comments in editing marks.

2003-10-26: Version 1.2.6pre4

- Fixed handling CAM menus in case the CAM connection fails while the menu
  is being presented (thanks to Thomas v. Keller for reporting this one).
- Added missing 'const' to some cChannel member functions (thanks to Torsten
  Herz).

2003-11-08: Version 1.2.6pre5

- Added cDevice::GetSTC() (suggested by Sven Goethel).
- Added Asia-Pacific satellites to 'sources.conf' (thanks to Richard Scobie).
- Added North American satellites to 'sources.conf' (thanks to Luke Jenkins).
- Fixed getting the list of recordings in case VDR is started from a directory
  where it doesn't have access to (thanks to Dirk Mueller).

2003-11-09: Version 1.2.6pre6

- Fixed handling Priority -1 in cDvbDevice::ProvidesChannel() (thanks to
  Torsten Herz).
- Fixed processing EPG data in case there is no title (thanks to Torsten Herz).

2003-11-14: Version 1.2.6

- Final release of version 1.2.6.

2004-01-04: Version 1.3.0

- Changed thread handling to make it work with NPTL ("Native Posix Thread Library").
  Thanks to Jon Burgess, Andreas Schultz, Werner Fink and Stefan Huelswitt.
- The cThread class now accepts a 'Description' parameter, which is used to log
  the beginning and end of the thread, together with its process and thread id.
  For descriptions that need additional parameters you can use the function
  cThread::SetDescription(), which accepts 'printf()' like arguments.
  Existing plugins that use threads should be changed to use this functionality
  instead of explicit 'dsyslog()' calls inside their Action() function in order
  to support logging the thread ids.
- Added "Slovak Link" and "Czech Link" to 'ca.conf' (thanks to Emil Petersky).
  However, 'ca.conf' is now pretty much obsolete due to the automatic CA handling.
- Mutexes are now created with PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK_NP, which makes the
  'lockingTid' stuff obsolete (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Changed font handling to allow language specific character sets.
- Adopted the small font character set from the "Elchi" patch (originally
  provided by Alessio Sangalli).
- Greek language texts now use iso8859-7 character set (thanks to Dimitrios
  Dimitrakos).
- Rearranged section data handling, so that the actual data handling can be done
  separately, even from within plugins.
- The EPG data structures have been moved from eit.[hc] to epg.[hc] and have been
  adapted to the general VDR coding style. Plugins that use these data structures
  may need to change some function names (which should be obvious).
  The name 'subtitle' has been changed to 'shortText' to avoid clashes with actual
  subtitles that are part of a movie. The name 'extendedDescription' has been
  shortened to 'description'.
- Replaced 'libdtv' with 'libsi' (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg), which is thread
  safe and can be used by multiple section filters simultaneously.
- Added 'cRwLock' to 'thread.[hc]'. Note that all plugin Makefiles need to
  define _GNU_SOURCE for this to work (see the example plugin Makefiles and
  'newplugin').
- Fixed a problem with crc32 in SI handling on 64bit systems (thanks to Pedro
  Miguel Sequeira de Justo Teixeira for reporting this one).
- Fixed an alignment problem in CAM access on 64bit systems  (thanks to Pedro
  Miguel Sequeira de Justo Teixeira for reporting this one).
- Added 'StreamType' setting to CAM communication, which is important for
  Aston/SECA CAMs (thanks to Antonino Sergi).
- Now the CA descriptors are sent to the CAM in the 'program' or 'ES level'
  sections, depending on where they are found in the PMT (thanks to Hans-Peter
  Raschke for reporting this one). This should make SkyCrypt CAMs work.
- Now using the 'version number' of EPG events to avoid unnecessary work.
- Channel data is now automatically derived from the DVB data stream (inspired
  by the 'autopid' patch from Andreas Schultz).
- The current channel is now automatically re-tuned if the PIDs or other settings
  change. If a recording is going on on a channel that has a change in its
  settings, the recording will be stopped and immediately restarted to use the
  new channel settings.
- EPG events now use the complete channel ID with NID, TID and SID.
- Channel names in 'channels.conf' can now have a short form, as provided
  by some tv stations (see man vdr(5)). Currently channels that provide short
  names in addition to long ones are listed in the OSD as "short,long name",
  as in "RTL,RTL Television". The short names will be used explicitly later.
- The Ca parameter in 'channels.conf' has been extended and now contains all the
  CA system ids for the given channel. When switching to a channel VDR now tests
  for a device that provides one of these CA system ids. The devices automatically
  get their supported ids from the CI handler.
- The values in 'ca.conf' are currently without any real meaning. Whether or not
  a channel with conditional access can be received is now determined automatically
  by evaluating its CA descriptors and comparing them to the CA system ids
  provided by the installed CAM. Only the special values 1-16 are used to assign
  a channel to a particular device.
- Increased the maximum number of possible OSD colors to 256.
- Limited the line length in the EPG bugfix report, which appears to fix a buffer
  overflow that caused a crash when cleaning up the EPG data (at 05:00 in the
  morning).

2004-01-11: Version 1.3.1

- Fixed a lockup in the EPG scanner when no non-primary device was available
  (thanks to Martin Holst for reporting this one).
- Fixed a compiler warning about virtual cConfig::Load() functions (thanks to
  Lauri Tischler for reporting this one).
- Fixed a warning about character comparison in libsi/si.c (thanks to Lauri
  Tischler for reporting this one).
- The new parameter "Update channels" in the "Setup/DVB" menu can be used to
  control if and how channels will be automatically updated (see MANUAL).
  This has already been part of the 'autopid' patch by Andreas Schultz and has
  now been adopted.
- Fixed a crash in case there is no DVB hardware present (thanks to Sascha
  Volkenandt for reporting this one).
- Changed calculation of channel ids to make it work for tv stations that use
  the undefined NID value 0 (thanks to Teemu Rantanen for reporting this one).
- Enhanced the SDT filter to handle multi part sections.
- Added support for selecting preferred EPG languages (based upon a patch by
  Teemu Rantanen).
- Fixed a 'const' in libsi/si.h (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Fixed the 'su' call in 'runvdr' to make it work on systems that require the
  user name to appear before the command option (thanks to Robert Huitl).
- Fixed testing for matching section filters in case they are turned off (thanks
  to Marcel Wiesweg).
- In case of incomplete sections an error message is now logged only every 10
  seconds.
- Fixed a possible NULL pointer access in cEITScanner::Process() (thanks to
  Andreas Kool).
- The actual transponder data is now taken from the NIT and existing channels
  are adjusted if necessary. If the NIT contains new transponders, they are
  scanned for channels during the next EPG scan. Note that only the satellite
  branches are tested, cable and terrestrial need to be tested by somebody who
  actually has such equipment.

2004-01-18: Version 1.3.2

- Fixed resetting the EPG data versions after changing the preferred languages
  (thanks to Teemu Rantanen for reporting this one and helping to debug it).
- Added LinkageDescriptor handling to 'libsi' (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Added Russian language texts (thanks to Vyacheslav Dikonov).
  Plugin authors may want to add the new entries to their I18N texts and contact
  the translators to have their texts translated. Note that there are now 17
  different OSD languages, so please make sure you have 17 versions for each of
  your texts.
- Some corrections and additions to the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg and Niko Tarnanen).
- Fixed a wrong 'delta' value in the call to the shutdown script (thanks to
  Stephan Epstein for reporting this one).
- Activated detection of radio channels (to avoid reports about "channels not
  being detected that used to be detected with the 'scan' utility or the
  original 'autopid' patch ;-).
- Channels with a zero VPID no longer write a PPID into channels.conf.
- Short channel names are now only stored if they actually differ from the
  full name.
- The EPG scan now scans newly found transponders together with already existing
  ones.
- The "Red" button in the "Setup/EPG" menu can now be used to force an EPG
  scan on a single DVB card system (see MANUAL for details).
- The new SVDRP command 'SCAN' can be used to force  an EPG scan on a single
  DVB card system (see MANUAL under Setup/EPG for details).
- Fixed handling PID changes in 'Transfer Mode'.
- Excess blanks in channel names read from the SDT are now removed.
- Fixed wrong parameter settings when scanning NITs for terrestrial transponders
  (thanks to Christian Tramnitz for pointing out this one).
- Fixed some out of bounds parameter settings when scanning NITs for cable
  and satellite transponders.
- Added 'libsi' include files to the 'include' directory, so that plugins can
  use them (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Now only processing NITs that contain the transponder they are actually
  broadcast on.
- Fixed setting the source type for newly detected terrestrial transponders
  (thanks to Christian Tramnitz for his support in debugging this).

2004-01-25: Version 1.3.3

- Completed the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added ISO639LanguageDescriptor to 'libsi'.
- Changed the 'languageCode' members in the descriptor classes of 'libsi' to
  'char[4]' and setting the 4th byte to 0 for easier handling.
- Fixed frequency handling when setting the CA descriptors in cDvbTuner::Action()
  (thanks to Jan Ekholm for reporting and helping to debug this one).
- Now setting CA descriptors even if "Setup/DVB/Update channels" is less than 2.
- There can now be up to 32 audio and Dolby PIDs (however, currently still only
  the first two are used throughout the rest of the program).
- The audio and Dolby PIDs in 'channels.conf' now can have an optional language
  code (see man vdr(5)). Currently this is only stored and not yet used otherwise.
- Added a call to cStatus::MsgOsdCurrentItem() to cMenuEditItem::SetValue()
  (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid).

2004-02-08: Version 1.3.4

- Fixed handling language codes in case there is no audio or Dolby PID.
- Fixed handling CA ids (was broken in 1.3.3).
- Fixed the SVDRP command 'STAT DISK' to avoid a 'division by 0' in case the
  disk is full (thanks to Jens Rosenboom).
- Fixed handling bitmap indexes for 256 color mode (thanks to Andreas Regel).
- Now handling "linked services" (based on the 'autopid' patch from Andreas
  Schultz). Linked channels are detected and added to 'channels.conf', but
  currently they are not yet presented to the user other than being in the
  normal channel list (this will come later).
- Preliminary fix for the "Unknown picture type error" (thanks to Sascha
  Volkenandt for his support in debugging this one). This may slow down switching
  between channels on different transponders for now, but a better solution will
  come later.
- Fixed the validity check for channel IDs, because some providers use TIDs with
  value 0 (thanks to Thomas Bergwinkl).
- Enabled switching to a channel even if it has no Vpid or Apid set, because these
  might be automatically set when tuned to that transponder.
- No longer closing the Channels menu after trying to switch to a channel that
  is currently not available.
- Removed the now obsolete CaCaps stuff. The Setup/CICAM menu now displays the
  actual CAM type as reported by the CAM. The 'ca.conf' file has been stripped
  down to the values 0..4.

2004-02-29: Version 1.3.5

- Fixed reading the EPG preferred language parameter from 'setup.conf'.
- Fixed switching to a visible programme in case the current channel has neither
  a video nor an audio PID.
- Fixed editing channels (SID now range checked) and creating new channels (NID,
  TID and RID are now set to 0).
- Fixed transponder handling to make it work with satellites that provide two
  transponders on the same frequency, with different polarization, like Hispasat
  at S30.0W (thanks to Thomas Bergwinkl for pointing this out). See man vdr(5)
  for details about the enhanced channel ID format.
- Since there appears to be no general solution for the UPT error yet, a recording
  now initiates an "emergency exit" if the number of UPT errors during one
  recording exceeds 10 (suggested by Gregoire Favre). Since the UPT error doesn't
  happen on my system, this has not been explicitly tested.
  The "preliminary fix" for the UPT error in VDR/dvbdevice.c has been disabled
  by default, since it makes channel switching unpleasantly slow. If you want
  to have that workaround back, you can uncomment the line
  //#define WAIT_FOR_LOCK_AFTER_TUNING 1
  in VDR/dvbdevice.c.
- Adapted the 'sky' plugin to use the actual channel IDs, and to fetch EPG data
  from www.bleb.org.
- Limited automatic retuning to devices that actually provide the transponder
  (necessary for the 'sky' plugin).
- Fixed handling receivers in the 'sky' plugin, so that a recording on the same
  channel won't interrupt an ongoing Transfer Mode.
- Added subtable ID and TSDT handling to 'libsi' (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Fixed some Russian OSD texts (thanks to Vyacheslav Dikonov).
- Added the 'running status' to the EPG events. This is necessary for implementing
  the VPS function for recording.
- Removed the obsolete 'present' and 'following' handling from the EPG data.
- The EPG data is now always kept sorted chronologically in the internal data
  structures. This also means that any EPG data retrieved through the SVRDP
  command LSTE is guaranteed to be sorted by start time.
- Now using the 'running status' in the channel display, so that a programme
  that has an end time that is before the current time, but is still running,
  will still be shown in the display (provided the broadcasters handle the
  'running status' flag correctly). This also applies to programmes that have
  a start time that is in the future, but are already running.
- Implemented an "EPG linger time", which can be set to have older EPG information
  still displayed in the "Schedule" menu (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti).
- Added PDCDescriptor handling to 'libsi'.
- Implemented handling the VPS timestamps (aka "Programme Identification Label")
  for full VPS support for timers (provided the tv stations actually broadcast
  this information). The VPS time is displayed in the event info page if it exists
  and is different than the event's start time.
- Extended the SVDRP command LSTE to allow limiting the listed data to a given
  channel, the present or following events, or events at a given time (thanks to
  Thomas Heiligenmann).
- Fixed a typo in libsi/si.h (thanks to Stéphane Esté-Gracias).
- Timers can now be set to use the VPS information to control recording a programme.
  The new setup options "Recording/Use VPS" and "Recording/VPS margin", as well as
  the "VPS" option in the individual timers, can be used to control this feature
  (see MANUAL for details).
  Note that this feature will certainly need a lot of testing before it can be
  called "safe"!
- The "Schedule" and "What's on now/next?" menus now have an additional column
  which displays information on whether there is a timer defined for an event,
  whether an event has a VPS time that's different than its start time, and
  whether an event is currently running (see MANUAL under "The "Schedule" Menu"
  for details).

2004-03-14: Version 1.3.6

- Completed the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed some descriptor handling in 'libsi' (thanks to Stéphane Esté-Gracias).
- Fixed handling the current menu item (thanks to Marc Hoppe).
- Fixed assigning events to timers (they no longer get "stuck").
- Added log entries whenever the running status of an event changes (currently
  only logging the first 30 channels).
- Fixed handling timers in VPS margin if the EPG scan is turned on (the EPG scan
  switched the device away from the channel, so it wouldn't see the change of
  the running status).
- Fixed handling "itemized" texts in EPG data (thanks to Stéphane Esté-Gracias
  for pointing out this problem, and Marcel Wiesweg for improving 'libsi').
- Fixed handling VPS times at year boundaries.
- Avoiding too many consecutive "ring buffer overflow" messages (which only
  slowed down performance even more).
- Taking the Sid into account when detecting version changes in processing the
  PMT (thanks to Stéphane Esté-Gracias for pointing out this problem).
- Completed the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Vyacheslav Dikonov).
- Any newline characters in the 'description' of EPG events are now preserved
  to allow texts to be displayed the way the tv stations have formatted them.
  This was also necessary to better display itemized texts.
- Fixed detecting the running status in case an empty EPG event is broadcast (thanks
  to Michael Pennewiß for pointing this out).
- Improved performance when paging through very long menu lists.
- Removed cSchedule::GetEventNumber() and cSchedule::NumEvents(). There is now
  cSchedule::Events() that returns the list of events directly.
- Avoiding occasional bad responsiveness to user interaction caused by assigning
  events to timers.
- Now explicitly turning on the LNB power at startup, because newer drivers don't
  do this any more (thanks to Oliver Endriss for pointing this out).

2004-05-16: Version 1.3.7

- Fixed a memory leak in thread handling when using NPTL (thanks to Jon Burgess).
- Fixed handling Setup.RecordDolbyDigital, which was broken since version 1.1.6.
- Fixed handling text lengths for itemized EPG texts (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Fixed the help for LSTE and LSTR (was broken in 1.3.6).
- Improved iso8859-7 fonts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Added some 3-letter language codes (thanks to Marcus Mönnig).
- Added language code handling to the subtitling descriptor in 'libsi' (thanks to
  Pekka Virtanen).
- Moved several menu item classes from menu.c to menuitems.[hc] to make them
  available for plugins.
- The epg2html.pl script now handles '|' in description texts.
- The new setup option "OSD/Use small font" can be used to control the use of
  the small font (see MANUAL for details).
- Swapped osd.[hc] and osdbase.[hc] to have the virtual OSD base class named cOsd.
  Plugins may need to adjust their #include statements.
- Colors are now given as AARRGGBB instead of AABBGGRR. The values are mapped to
  the driver's (wrong) sequence in dvbosd.c (this should really be fixed in the
  driver, together with the endian problem).
- The new OSD setup parameters "Left" and "Top" can be used to define the top left
  corner of the OSD.
- The OSD size parameters are now in pixel (as opposed to formerly characters).
  When reading a 'setup.conf' file from an older version of VDR, the OSDwidth
  and OSDheight values will be converted to pixel automatically.
- The OSD is now fully device independent. See the comments in VDR/osd.h and the
  description in PLUGINS.html for information on how a plugin can implement an OSD
  display on arbitrary hardware.
- The OSD (actually its cBitmap class) can now handle XPM files. There are several
  XPM files in the VDR/symbols directory which can be used by skins (some of these
  have been taken from the "elchi" patch). See VDR/skinsttng.c for examples on how
  to use these.
- Due to the changes in the OSD handling the DEBUG_OSD option for a textual OSD
  has been dropped. There will be a plugin that implements a skin with this
  functionality later.
- The entire OSD display can now be implemented via "skins". See VDR/skins.[hc],
  VDR/skinclassic.[hc], VDR/skinsttng.[hc] and PLUGINS.html for information on how
  a plugin can implement its own skin. By default VDR comes with a "Classic" skin
  that implements the OSD display known from previous versions, and the new skin
  named "ST:TNG Panels", which is also the default skin now. The actual skin can
  be selected through "Setup/OSD/Skin".
- The colors used in a skin can now be configured using "themes". See PLUGINS.html
  for information on how a skin can make use of themes, and man vdr(5) for the
  structure of a theme file. The actual theme to use can be selected through
  "Setup/OSD/Theme".
- Added Croatian language texts (thanks to Drazen Dupor).
  NOTE: there is apparently a problem with the newly introduced iso8859-2 font,
  because as soon as Setup/OSD/Language is set to Croatian (currently the last one
  in the list) everything freezes and the vdr processes have to be killed with -9
  and the driver needs to be reloaded. Maybe somebody else can find out what's
  going wrong here...
- Added missing NULL checks when accessing sectionHandler in device.c (thanks to
  Pekka Virtanen).
- Fixed setting the time from the DVB data stream (thanks to Helmut Auer for
  pointing out a frequency/transponder handling mixup). This now also takes the
  actual source (sat, cable etc.) into account. Please go into "Setup/EPG" and
  set the "Set system time" and "Use time from transponder" parameters accordingly
  (this is necessary even if you have already set them before!).

2004-05-23: Version 1.3.8

- Fixed a crash when switching the skin and having selected a non-default theme
  that is not available for the newly selected skin (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed some issues with gcc 3.4 (thanks to Prakash K. Cheemplavam and Marcel
  Wiesweg).
- Added a hint to PLUGINS.html about how to name a plugin that implements a skin.
- Completed the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Single shot timers and events now show the day of week (adopted with some changes
  from the "elchi" patch, originally introduced by Oskar Signell). Plugins that use
  cEvent::GetDateString() should note that this function now returns a longer
  string, including the day of week. The new function const char *WeekDayName(time_t t)
  can be called with a time_t value to get the day of week for that time.
- When processing XPM data, the color name "None" is now mapped to #00000000, which
  is "fully transparent" (suggested by Sascha Volkenandt).
- Fixed the OSD alignment in the SPU decoder (thanks to Miko Wohlgemuth for reporting
  this one and helping to test the fix).
- Fixed freezing picture when a recording starts on a system that always uses
  'Transfer Mode' (thanks to Michal Dobrzynski for reporting this one).
- Fixed a memory leak in NIT processing (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Added a few missing initializations (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Moved the declaration of cMenuText to VDR/menu.h to make it available to plugins.
  It now also has a SetText() function that can be used to dynamically set the text
  in an already existing cMenuText (both suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added play mode pmVideoOnly (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Added a missing cStatus::MsgOsdClear() to cDisplayChannel::~cDisplayChannel()
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- No longer displaying unused color buttons in the "Classic VDR" skin (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).
- Added some missing cStatus::MsgOsdTextItem() calls (thanks to Oliver Endriss for
  reporting this one).

2004-05-31: Version 1.3.9

- Completed Croatian language texts (thanks to Drazen Dupor).
- New iso8859-2 font to fix the problem with program freezes (thanks to Drazen Dupor).
- Implemented a default cRemote::Initialize() that waits 10 seconds for a keypress
  in order to prevent a "hangup" in case, e.g., the LIRC driver is not loaded (thanks
  to Helmut Auer).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Hannover (thanks to Peter Waechtler).
- cBitmap::DrawBitmap() now also resets the palette if the entire bitmap area is
  covered (suggested by Sascha Volkenandt).
- Fixed setting the title in the replay display of the "Classic VDR" skin in case
  a shorter title is set after a longer one (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt for
  reporting this one).
- Now using more separate areas in the "ST:TNG Panels" skin to allow a theme to
  use more independent clrMenu* colors.
- Fixed removing the "scanning recordings..." message in case the video directory
  is empty (thanks to Andreas Regel for reporting this one).
- Added SetMessage() functions to the Replay and Channel skin functions. Plugins
  that implement skins will need to implement these functions. This fixes a missing
  "Editing process finished" message (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this
  one).
- Fixed the height of the channel display in the "Classic VDR" skin.
- Fixed handling descriptor loops in 'libsi', which had sometimes caused invalid
  CA ids to be added to the channel definitions (thanks to Wayne Keer for reporting
  this one, and Marcel Wiesweg for fixing it).
- Fixed handling colors in cDvbSpuPalette::yuv2rgb() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Made some functions of cFont virtual to allow implementing dummy fonts for the
  'curses' skin.
- The new plugin 'skincurses' re-implements the functionality that was previously
  available by compiling VDR with DEBUG_OSD. Some things may not yet work as they
  should, but it's a starting point.

2004-06-06: Version 1.3.10

- Fixed some default parameters in 'skincurses'.
- Fixed cBitmap::DrawPixel(), which messed with other bitmaps' palettes in case
  the pixel coordinates were outside this bitmap (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for
  reporting this one).
- The cBitmap::DrawText() function now doesn't set any background pixels if the
  given background color is clrTransparent. This allows drawing "transparent"
  texts (suggested by Sascha Volkenandt).
- The cBitmap::SetXpm() function now ignores unused "none" color entries, which
  some broken graphics tools write into XPM files (suggested by Sascha Volkenandt).
- No longer setting lnb voltage if the frontend is not DVB-S (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler).
- Fixed displaying the current channel when switching via the SVDRP command CHAN
  (thanks to Jürgen Schmitz for reporting this one).
- Fixed missing audio after replaying a DVD (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Added a note about the default assignment of the color keys to MANUAL.
- Added a note about NPTL ("Native Posix Thread Library") to the INSTALL file
  (apparently the "fix" in version 1.3.0 didn't really fix this).
- Modified 'libsi' to require callers to state the buffer sizes when getting
  strings in order to avoid buffer overflows (thanks to Philip Lawatsch for
  debugging a buffer overflow in eit.c).

2004-06-19: Version 1.3.11

- In order to avoid problems on NPTL systems, VDR now checks for the presence
  of NPTL at program start, and if it is, exits and tells the user to do
  'export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1' before starting VDR.
- Revisited the "Fixed missing audio after replaying a DVD" change because it
  introduced a sound disturbance when switching between channels on the same
  transponder (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- In order to avoid problems on UTF-8 systems, VDR now checks for the presence
  of UTF-8 at program start, and if it is, exits and tells the user to turn off
  UTF-8 before starting VDR (thanks to Ludwig Nussel for pointing out a problem
  with systems that are set to use UTF-8). There are also problems in case the
  video partition is mounted with "iocharset=utf8" (thanks to Jörg Knitter for
  reporting this one).
  Please also read the "IMPORTANT NOTES" section in the INSTALL file!
- Some changes to the SPU decoder interface (thanks to Sven Goethel).
- Some improvements in cOsd creation (thanks to some suggestions by Jouni Karvo).
- Fixed calculating the OSD width and height (thanks to Olaf Henkel for reporting
  a problem with long event texts in the "Classic VDR" skin).
- Fixed switching channels while an encrypted channel is being recorded, because the
  channel was switched if the new channel was on the same transponder and was
  a radio channel or an unencrypted channel (thanks to Martin Dauskardt for reporting
  this one).
- No longer using the external 'find' command to scan the video directory for
  recordings (based on a suggestion by Mirko Dölle).
- The list of recordings is now kept statically in memory to avoid long delays
  when opening the "Recordings" menu. As a side effect, external modifications to
  the video directory are no longer immediately reflected in the "Recordings" menu.
  If a plugin manipulates the video directory in any way, it can call the function
  Recordings.TriggerUpdate() to trigger an update of the list of recordings.
  If some external tool manipulates the video directory, it can touch the file
  '.update' in the video directory to trigger an update of the list of recordings.
- Fixed a memory leak in theme description handling (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt).
- Added cDevice::Flush() to make sure that all data in the video card's buffers
  has been processed (thanks to Reinhard Nissl). Currently this is not yet actually
  implemented for FF DVB cards.
- Fixed handling the color button texts in cMenuEditStrItem (thanks to Maynard
  Cedric for reporting this one).
- Fixed the description of cRingBufferLinear (thanks to Ludwig Nussel for pointing
  out this one).
- Fixed cRingBufferLinear::Get() in case the buffer wraps around (thanks to Ludwig
  Nussel for reporting this one).

2004-07-18: Version 1.3.12

- Removed all error messages from cRecordings::ScanVideoDir() and just skipping
  entries that cause errors in order to avoid failure in case of things like
  broken links etc.
- The function cTimers::SetEvents() now immediately returns if there is some user
  input.
- Fixed handling menu status messages when the list contents is scrolled (thanks to
  Alfred Zastrow for reporting this one).
- Fixed checking the last area for misalignment in cOsd::CanHandleAreas() (thanks
  to Reinhard Nissl for reporting this one).
- No longer adding section filters to the list of filters if they can't be opened
  (thanks to Marco Schlüßler for pointing this out).
- Fixed handling error case '-1' when polling section filters (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler).
- Fixed handling error case '-1' when polling CAM connections.
- Making sure the OSD reports oeWrongAlignment errors before any oeAreasOverlap
  error (suggested by Reinhard Nissl).
- Avoiding flashing effects in the OSD of full featured DVB cards by explicitly
  clearing the OSD windows before opening them (suggested by Marco Schlüßler).
- Experimental support for NVOD channels. Currently these channels are detected
  and linked to their "base" channels using the same mechanisms as for the
  "linked services" (let's see if this is useful). Thanks to Mike parker for
  helping to test this. Also used some input from the 'autopid' patch by Andreas
  Schultz).
- Now storing the name of the service provider (aka "bouquet") in the channel
  name, separated by a semicolon (see man vdr(5) for details). Explicit usage
  of the various parts of the channel name is yet to come.
- The 'radio' channel icon is now only displayed in the ST:TNG skin if the channel
  actually has an APID.

2004-10-17: Version 1.3.13

- Fixed checking for the presence of NPTL (thanks to Jouni Karvo).
- Making sure section filters are only set if the device actually has a lock
  (thanks to Andreas Share for pointing this out).
- Fixed a possible NULL pointer assignment in cMenuText::SetText() (thanks to
  Marco Schlüssler).
- Fixed a crash in case the last line in channels.conf is a group separator and
  that group is selected in the channel display (thanks to Dick Streefland).
- Added cRingBufferLinear::Read() to read directly from a file handle into the
  ring buffer.
- Using timeouts in ring buffers to avoid 'usleep()'.
- Clearing the 'Transfer Mode' ring buffer after clearing the device to avoid
  an "almost full" ring buffer.
- Removed locking from cRingBufferLinear for better performance under high load.
- Using a cRingBufferLinear in cRemux to avoid unnecessary copying of data.
- Using a cRingBufferLinear in cTSBuffer and filling it in a separate thread
  to avoid buffer overflows. Plugins using cTSBuffer will need to remove the
  call to the now obsolete Read() function (see cDvbDevice::GetTSPacket() for
  the new usage of cTSBuffer).
- cRemux::Process() has been split into Put(), Get() and Del() to allow for a
  better decoupling of the remuxing and disk writing process. Plugins using
  cRemux will need to be modified accordingly.
- The actual disk writing in recordings is now done in a separate thread to
  improve the overall throughput.
- Changed cRemux so that it returns the maximum available amount of data with
  each call, not just 2048 byte.
- Added a visual display of all cRingBufferLinear buffers for debugging. To
  activate it, define DEBUGRINGBUFFERS in ringbuffer.h.
- Instead of cCondVar now using the new cCondWait (which also avoids a possible
  "near miss" condition; thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for pointing out this one).
  cCondVar is still present for plugins that use it (and VDR itself also still
  uses it in cRemote).
- The cRingBuffer now does EnableGet()/EnablePut() only if the buffer is more than
  one third full or empty, respectively. This dramatically improves recording
  performance and reduces system load (thanks to Marco Schlüßler for doing some
  testing regarding buffer performance and giving me some hints that finally led
  to finding out that this was the basic problem causing buffer overflows).
- Improved Transfer Mode (thanks to Marco Schlüßler for suggestions and testing).
- Fixed a possible crash with inconsistent SI data (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Fixed showing the replay mode if the OSD is currently in use (thanks to Kimmo
  Tykkala for pointing out this problem).
- cOsdProvider::NewOsd() now always returns a valid pointer, even if the OSD is
  currently in use (it will then return a dummy cOsd object and write a message to
  the log file).
- Added Estonian language texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Fixed 'newplugin' and libsi/Makefile to use the compiler defined in $(CXX) for
  generating file dependencies (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Moved the initialization of aPid1 and aPid2 to the beginning of cDvbDevice::cDvbDevice()
  to have them set in case a patch references them (thanks to Wayne Keer for pointing
  this out).
- Completed the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Vyacheslav Dikonov).
- Avoiding unnecessary section filter start/stops (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Made the "Channel not available!" message and mtInfo instead of mtError (suggested
  by Wayne Keer).
- Made volume control more linear (thanks to Emil Naepflein and Udo Richter).
- Now skipping code table info in SI data (suggested by Milos Kapoun).
- Added missing Czech characters to fontosd-iso8859-2.c (thanks to Milos Kapoun).
- Fixed a crash in the time search mechanism (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- If one PID can't be added, the whole cDevice::AttachReceiver() will now fail
  and all PIDs added so far will be deleted (thanks to Marco Schlüßler for
  pointing out this one).
- Now only saving channels.conf after a modification made by the user (avoids
  lots of disk access due to automatic channel updates). Automatic channel
  modifications will be saved every 10 minutes if no recording is currently
  active.
- Removed the 'Log' parameter from the cChannel::Set... functions. Instead
  checking if the channel has a non-zero number.
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Hannover (thanks to Sven Kreiensen).

2004-10-24: Version 1.3.14

- Fixed detecting transponder lock in cDvbTuner (based on a patch from Stefan
  Meyknecht).
- What was previously marked with WAIT_FOR_LOCK_AFTER_TUNING is now permanently
  active and uses a cCondVar to signal when a transponder is locked.
- Added some missing 'const' to cChannel.
- Added a sample setup for 'DisiCon-4 Single Cable Network' to 'diseqc.conf'
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed attaching a cPlayer to a cDevice, so that 'Operation not permitted'
  errors don't occur any more (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed a case where the resultBuffer in cRemux ran full before getting a sync.
- Removed the usleep() call from cDvbPlayer::Action() to make VDR run on NPTL
  systems (thanks to Alfred Zastrow). The NPTL check at startup has also been
  removed.
- Taking the complete size of available data into account when deciding whether
  to clear the transfer buffer to avoid overflows (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Updated Romanian language texts and the iso8859-2 fonts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Now actually using the iso8859-15 fonts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Some minor code cleanups (thanks to Prakash K. Cheemplavam).
- Fixed missing cleanup at program exit in case there is a problem with a plugin
  (thanks to Mattias Grönlund for pointing this out).
- Increased the required free buffer space in the resultBuffer of cRemux to
  2 * IPACKS to avoid a buffer overflow in case a cTS2PES writes one complete
  packet and then (within processing the same TS packet) wants to write another
  small packet.
- Removed the signal handler and WakeUp() call from cThread (it is no longer
  needed).
- Added some checks when canceling a thread and removed the usleep() in
  cThread::Start() (suggested by Ludwig Nussel). Also removed 'running' from
  cThread and using only childTid to indicate whether a thread is actually
  running.
- Added cCondWait::Sleep() and using it to replace all usleep() calls (based
  on a suggestion by Werner Fink).
- Only assigning events to timers if the related schedule has actually been
  modified.
- When searching for the present event, the running status is now only taken
  into account if the event has been "seen" within the past 30 seconds.
  This avoids shortly seeing the wrong events in the channel display when
  switching to a channel that hasn't been tuned to in a while.

2004-11-01: Version 1.3.15

- Fixed some typos in the Makefile's 'font' target (thanks to Uwe Hanke).
- Added more checks and polling when getting frontend events (based on a patch
  from Werner Fink).
- No longer explicitly waiting for a tuner lock when switching channels
  (apparently setting "live" PIDs before the tuner is locked doesn't hurt).
  Moved the wait into cDevice::AttachReceiver() instead.
- Immediately displaying the new channel info when switching channel groups.
- Moved the main program loop variables further up to allow compilation with
  older compiler versions (thanks to Marco Schlüßler for reporting this one).
- Now calling pthread_cond_broadcast() in the destructor of cCondWait and
  cCondVar to make sure any sleepers will wake up (suggested by Werner Fink).
  Also using pthread_cond_broadcast() instead of pthread_cond_signal() in
  cCondWait, in case there is more than one sleeper.
- Making sure that timers and channels are only saved together, in a consistent
  manner (thanks to Mirko Dölle for reporting a problem with inconsistent
  channel and timer lists).
- Now handling the channel name, short name and provider separately. cChannel
  therefore has two new functions, ShortName() and Provider(). ShortName()
  can be used to display a short version of the name (in case such a version
  is available). The optional boolean parameter of ShortName() can be set to
  true to make it return the name, if no short name is available.
  The sequence of 'name' and 'short name' in the channels.conf file has been
  swapped (see man vdr(5)).
- Added the 'portal name' to cChannels (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed handling key codes that start with 0x1B in the KBD remote control code.
- Now using qsort() to sort cListBase lists. For this, the virtual function
  cListObject::operator<() has been replaced with cListObject::Compare().
  Plugins that implement derived cListObject classes may need to adjust their
  code.
- The "Channels" menu can now be sorted "by number" (default), "by name" and
  "by provider". While in the "Channels" menu, pressing the '0' key switches
  through these modes.
- Fixed the buffer size in cRecording::SortName().
- Now displaying the name of the remote control for which the keys are being
  learned inside the menu to avoid overwriting the date/time in the 'classic'
  skin (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).

2004-11-14: Version 1.3.16

- Fixed cChannel::SetName() in case only the ShortName or Provider has changed
  (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for reporting this one).
- Added Danish language texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Reactivated the NPTL check at startup because there appear to be still
  unsolved problems when running on NPTL systems.
- Added missing calls to cStatus::MsgOsdClear() in cSkins::Message() (thanks
  to Joachim Wilke for reporting this one, and Andreas Regel for additional
  input).
- Fixed the cDvbSpuDecoder (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed handling of pmAudioOnlyBlack (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed a short glitch when starting a recording on the primary device while
  in replay or transfer mode (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Added missing initialization of cEvent::seen.
- Checking PID language codes for ISO 639 compliance to avoid problems with
  funny characters. Invalid language codes will be stored as "???".
- The '0' key now toggles the "Day" item in the "Timers" menu between "single
  shot" and "repeating". The keys '1'...'7' can be used to toggle the individual
  days ('1' is Monday). Thanks to Sascha Klek for reporting a problem with the
  '0' key in the "Day" item of the "Timers" menu.

2004-11-21: Version 1.3.17

- Fixed cRemux::ScanVideoPacket() to make sure it doesn't access memory beyond
  the end of the given buffer, which has caused some unjustified "unknown
  picture type errors" (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed a possible crash when pausing live video and the recording was unable
  to start, maybe because there was no lock on the device (thanks to Andreas
  Brugger for reporting this one).
- Fixed some characters in the iso8859-2 font file (thanks to Dino Ravnic).
- Fixed some errors in the Croatian language texts (thanks to Dino Ravnic).
- Fixed a possible recursion in cControl::Shutdown() (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt).
- Now setting the VPID before the APID in live mode to avoid unnecessary
  overhead in the firmware (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Now checking available OSD memory at runtime (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed some typos in the Makefile's 'font' target (thanks to Olaf Titz).
- Fixed handling childTid in cThread to avoid possible race conditions (thanks
  to Stefan Huelswitt for pointing this out).
- Fixed toggling the "Day" item in the "Timers" menu, so that it selects the
  right day of week for timers in the future.
- Some improvements to cPoller (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).

2005-01-09: Version 1.3.18

- Removed an unused variable from cTimer::GetWDayFromMDay() (thanks to Wayne Keer
  for reporting this one).
- Some more changes to the 'childTid' handling in cThread (based on suggestions by
  Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed the spelling of 'canceling' (thanks to Wayne Keer for reporting this one).
- Re-introduced a sleep to cDvbPlayer::Action() to avoid high CPU load in still
  picture mode (thanks to Reinhard Nissl for reporting this one).
- Fixed a possible race condition in generating the DVB device names (thanks to
  Rainer Zocholl for reporting this one).
- Changed the way PES packets are played to allow replay of AC3 sound over the
  full featured DVB cards (partially based on a patch from Werner Fink).
  + The new function cDevice::PlayPes() is now called with the complete PES data
    stream and calls PlayVideo() and PlayAudio() as necessary.
  + cDevice::PlayVideo() is now only called with actual video PES packets.
  + cDevice::PlayAudio() is now called with the actual audio PES packets, which
    can be either "normal" audio or AC3 data. You need at least firmware version
    0x261d to replay AC3 sound over a full featured DVB card. This function now
    has an 'int' return value.
  + PlayAudio() of derived cDevice classes shall no longer call the base class
    function. It shall just play the given data as audio.
  + cPlayer::PlayVideo() and cPlayer::PlayAudio() are now obsolete and have been
    replaced with cPlayer::PlayPes().
  + All StripAudioPackets() functions are now obsolete. The functionality has been
    moved into cDevice::PlayPes(), where only the video and audio packets that are
    actually required will be processed.
  + All audio track handling is now done by cDevice; cTransfer and cDvbPlayer no
    longer care about audio tracks. cPlayer, however, still has the virtual hooks
    for audio track handling in order to allow plugins to implement players that
    have their own idea about this.
  + cChannel::[AD]pid[12]() have been replaced with cChannel::[AD]pid(int i) to
    allow access to all available PIDs.
- Escaped the '-' and 'ö' characters in the man pages (thanks to Darren Salt for
  pointing this out).
- Completed the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Sean Carlos).
- Fixed setting 'synced' in cRemux when recording radio channels (thanks to
  Laurence Abbott).
- Removed the LOCK_THREAD from the LIRC thread (thanks to Ludwig Nussel).
- Fixed genfontfile.c (sometimes the character width was wrong, and the codes were
  shifted one too far to the left).
- Fixed the character width and shifted the codes one to the right in all font
  files.
- Renamed font???.c to font???-iso8859-1.c for symmetry.
- Switched the character set to iso8859-15 for English, German and Finnish (thanks
  to Andreas Brugger for reporting the missing Euro sign in iso8859-1).
- Added 'channels.conf.terr' entries for Lübeck (thanks to Stefan Hußfeldt).
- Fixed a race condition in starting a thread (thanks to Reinhard Nissl for
  reporting this one).
- Replaced non-threadsafe library functions with their threadsafe versions (thanks
  to Rainer Zocholl for pointing this out).
- Other non-threadsafe functions have been replaced by threadsafe classes that hide
  the actual buffering. In particular these are:
  readdir() -> cReadDir
  readline() -> cReadLine
- Several formerly non-threadsafe functions now have a return type of cString:
  cChannel::ToText()
  tChannelID::ToString()
  cEvent::GetDateString()
  cEvent::GetTimeString()
  cEvent::GetEndTimeString()
  cEvent::GetVpsString()
  cMark::ToText()
  cTimer::ToText()
  cSource::ToString()
  cTimer::PrintDay()
  cTimer::PrintFirstDay()
  PrefixVideoFileName()
  IndexToHMSF()
  ChannelString()
  strescape()
  AddDirectory()
  itoa()
  WeekDayName()
  DayDateTime()
  When using these functions in a 'const char *' context there is nothing special
  to consider, except that you can no longer have a pointer to the return value,
  as in
  const char *date = DayDateTime();
  Although this will compile without error message, the resulting 'date' will not
  be valid after this line. Use this instead:
  cString date = DayDateTime();
  In a 'const void *' context (as in printf() etc.) the result needs to be
  dereferenced with a '*', as in
  printf("%s", *DayDateTime());
  to make it a 'const char *'.
- Removed delay_ms(), using cCondWait::SleepMs() instead.
- Replaced time_ms() with a threadsafe and non-overflowing cTimeMs (thanks to Rainer
  Zocholl for pointing out this problem).
- Added cDevice::mutexReceiver to avoid a race condition when attaching/detaching
  receivers from different threads.
- The new remote control button "Audio" can be used to switch between different
  audio tracks. The "Green" button in the "Main" menu has been changed from "Language"
  to "Audio", since it now also controls switching between normal and Dolby Digital
  audio tracks (see MANUAL for details).
- The description of the audio tracks is now taken from the "component descriptors"
  that are broadcast in the EPG data. However (as no big surprise), not all channels
  actually provide useful data here, so there are now some additional EPG bugfixes,
  which can be activated by setting the "EPG bugfix level" to 3.
- The format of the 'epg.data' files has been extended by the new tag 'X', which
  contains the stream components of an event (see man vdr(5) for details).
- The cStatus class now has the new member function SetAudioTrack(), which can be
  used to get notified when the audio track has been switched, and the new member
  function SetAudioChannel() which is called when the audio channel is changed.
- Skins need to implement the new cSkinDisplayTrack class to display the audio
  track menu.
- The ST:TNG skin now displays the current audio track description (if any) at the
  bottom left side.
- The new setup option "DVB/Audio languages" can be used to control which audio
  language shall be selected in case a channel broadcasts in different languages
  (see MANUAL for details).
- The "Left" and "Right" keys in the "Audio" menu can be used to switch between
  the left and right stereo channels in case there are different audio tracks
  in these channels (see MANUAL for details).
- Fixed a possible race condition in cDevice::Action() (thanks to Mattias Grönlund).
- Fixed the default quality value when grabbing a JPEG image (thanks to Patrick
  Gleichmann).
- Fixed deleting a menu item in case the next item is not selectable (thanks to
  Dino Ravnic).
- Implemented displaying mandatory subtitles in the SPU decoder (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler).
- The setup option "Recording/Record Dolby Digital" has been renamed and moved to
  "DVB/Use Dolby Digital". It now controls whether Dolby Digital is recorded and
  whether an available DD audio track will appear in the "Audio" menu.
- Added support for circular polarization (thanks to Jonan Santiago).
- Thanks to Werner Fink, Reinhard Nissl, Sascha Volkenandt and Bjørnar Nilsen for
  their support in testing and fine tuning this version.

2005-01-23: Version 1.3.19

- Making sure at least the default skin is available at program start in case a
  plugin needs to issue an error message (thanks to Achim Tuffentshammer for
  reporting a crash in such a case). Also checking if there is a current skin
  in cSkins::Message().
- Completed the Finnish OSD texts and fixed internationalization of the text
  for "Setup/DVB/Audio language(s)" (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Completed the Estonian OSD texts and switched to iso8859-13 character set
  (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Made cCondWait::SleepMs() sleep at least 3ms to avoid a possible busy wait.
- Fixed canceling the LIRC thread (thanks to Marco Schlüßler for pointing out
  this one).
- The "Green" button in the "Main" menu is now always "Audio", since the audio
  channel might be changed even if there is only one actual audio PID.
- Fixed handling the '-E' option which was broken in version 1.3.18 (thanks to
  Christian Jacobsen for reporting this one).
- Added 'channels.conf.terr' entries for Mainz (thanks to Michael Heyse).
- Implemented cDolbyRepacker for better handling of Dolby Digital PES packets
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed playing files with PES packets longer than 2048 byte through the full
  featured DVB card (thanks to Marco Kremer for reporting this one and providing
  a test sample).
- Recording and Transfer Mode now handle more than 2 audio PIDs. For this the
  interfaces of the following functions have been changed:
  cTransferControl::cTransferControl()
  cTransfer::cTransfer()
  cRecorder::cRecorder()
  cReceiver::cReceiver()
  cRemux::cRemux()
- Fixed a possible race condition in cDevice::Action() and cTSBuffer::Action()
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Extended some buffer sizes to allow handling HDTV streams (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Added 'channels.conf.terr' entries for Düsseldorf and Köln (thanks to Walter Koch).
- Falling back to 'stereo' when switching channels in case the user had switched
  to 'left' or 'right' (suggested by Rolf Groppe).
- Completed the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Recording and Transfer Mode can now handle up to 8 Dolby Digital tracks (thanks
  to Marco Schlüßler for a patch that implements substream handling into
  cDevice::PlayPesPacket(), and Reinhard Nissl for adding substream handling to
  cDolbyRepacker).
- Added PlayPes(NULL, 0) to cTransfer::Action() when clearing the transfer buffer
  to avoid overflows (thanks to Marco Schlüßler for pointing this out).

2005-02-06: Version 1.3.20

- Fixed displaying the "Audio" menu with the "Green" button from the "Main" menu
  in case there is only one audio track (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for reporting
  this one).
- Now setting primaryDevice = NULL before deleting the devices in cDevice::Shutdown()
  to avoid problems in case other threads access it (thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald for
  pointing this out).
- Fixed a buffer overflow in case a station defines all 32 audio PIDs (thanks to
  Christian Jacobsen for reporting this one).
- Fixed masking SubStreamType in cDevice::PlayPesPacket() (thanks to Werner Fink
  for pointing out this one).
- The new function cPlugin::Stop() shall be used to stop any background activities
  of a plugin. Previously this was done in the plugin's destructor, but it is
  better to do this in a dedicated function that can be called early when shutting
  down.
- Moved the call to SetAudioChannel(0) into cDevice::ClrAvailableTracks() to have it
  executed also when starting a replay.
- Completed the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Completed the French OSD texts (thanks to Olivier Jacques).
- The new setup option "OSD/Channel info time" can be used to define the time after
  which the channel display is removed if no key has been pressed (thanks to
  Olivier Jacques).
- Modified cDolbyRepacker to make sure PES packets don't exceed the requested length
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed several memory leaks that were introduced through the use of cString (thanks
  to Stefan Huelswitt for reporting these).
- Added CMD_SPU_CHG_COLCON to cDvbSpuDecoder::setTime() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Making sure the current audio track is actually one of the ones available in a
  recording (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for reporting a problem when starting
  replay of a recording that has no Dolby Digital audio after switching to a channel
  that has DD and selecting the DD audio track).
- Removed 'flags' from tTrackId (thought we would need this, but apparently we don't).
- Making sure the "Mute" and "Volume+/-" keys don't interfere with digital audio.
- Fixed the "pre 1.3.19" compatibility mode for old Dolby Digital recordings (thanks
  to Werner Fink for pointing out that this can be triggered in the default branch).
- Calling pesAssembler->Reset() in cDevice::AttachPlayer() to avoid problems with
  residual data in replay and Transfer Mode (thanks to Werner Fink for pointing this
  out).
- Added MPEG1 replay capability to cPesAssembler (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).

2005-02-13: Version 1.3.21

- Fixed cDvbDevice::SetAudioTrackDevice() to avoid a blank screen after switching
  back to live mode if a recording is currently active on the primary device.
- Fixed a possible freeze in pause mode in case a device's PlayPesPacket() function
  permanently returns 0 (thanks to Reinhard Nissl and Olaf Titz).
- Completed the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Restricted the "setting audio track" log message to automatic changes during replay.
- Fixed handling Transfer Mode for radio channels (thanks to Andreas Regel for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed handling symbolic links in cRecordings::ScanVideoDir() (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Completed the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Forcing a new resync after a call to cRemux::Clear() (suggested by Marco Schlüßler).
- The cAudio::Play() function now has an additional parameter 'uchar Id' which tells
  the function the substream id of the given audio packet, so that a plugin can
  take the right action for the various kinds if audio data - which now also includes
  "normal" audio with ids 0xC0...0xDF (based on suggestions by Werner Fink and Macro
  Schlüßler).
- Removed the "Cleared/PlayPes(NULL, 0)" handling from cTransfer::Action(), since this
  is now done when attaching the player to the device (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Making sure the buffer reserve in cTransfer::Action() is re-established after
  clearing the buffer.
- Added DeviceClrAvailableTracks() and DeviceSetCurrentAudioTrack() to cPlayer
  (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed a typo in detecting UTF-8 (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Now using twice the buffer reserve in cTransfer if the primary DVB card is an
  unmodified version with only 2MB of SDRAM, to avoid audio stuttering when
  playing Dolby Digital over the DVB card (thanks to Christian Jacobsen and Chad
  Flynt for suggestions and experiments in that area).
- Making sure the first audio packet is not dropped when switching to "pre 1.3.19
  Dolby Digital compatibility mode".
- The 'plugins-clean' target of the Makefile now only deletes the actual plugin
  library files from this version of VDR (suggested by Andreas Brachold).
- Added a missing 'resultSkipped = 0' to cRemux::Clear() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler
  for reporting this one).
- The new function cDvbDevice::SetTransferModeForDolbyDigital() can be used by
  plugins that implement Dolby Digital output and thus want to prevent the cDvbDevice
  from starting Transfer Mode in order to replay DD over the DVB device.
- Added missing reset of the 'repacker' to cTS2PES::Clear() (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler for reporting this one).

2005-02-27: Version 1.3.22

- Removed some unneeded code and fixed access to unallocated memory in
  cEvent::FixEpgBugs() (thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald).
- Avoiding unnecessary calls to SetPid() in cDvbDevice::SetAudioTrackDevice()
  (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- No longer calling EnsureAudioTrack() in cDevice::SetChannel() if a Transfer Mode is
  started, to avoid setting the audio PID on the primary device (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler for pointing this out).
- Replaced the call to system("sync") in SpinUpDisk() with fdatasync(f) to avoid
  problems on NPTL systems (thanks to Chris Warren for pointing this out).
- Increased POLLTIMEOUTS_BEFORE_DEVICECLEAR in transfer.c to 6 to avoid problems
  with the larger buffer reserve (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed the call to SetVideoFormat() in cDvbDevice::cDvbDevice() (parameter is _bool_).
- Added support for setting the video display mode (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- The new setup option "DVB/Video display format" can be used to define which display
  format to use for playing wide screen video on a 4:3 tv set.
- Changed MAXDPIDS to 16 (8xAC3 + 8xDTS) (thanks to Werner Fink for pointing this out).
- Completed Dutch language texts (thanks to Hans Dingemans).
- Added 'smi' to the Finnish language codes (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed ensuring there is a current audio track in case there is only one track
  (thanks to Werner Fink for reporting this one).
- Improved automatic audio track selection.
- Keeping the track language codes and descriptions in Transfer Mode (thanks to
  Luca Olivetti).
- Fixed handling repeated kAudio keys.
- Improved displaying the the current audio track in the ST:TNG channel display.

2005-03-20: Version 1.3.23

- The setup option "DVB/Video display format" is now only available if "Video format"
  is set to "4:3" (suggested by Mikko Salo).
- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Vyacheslav Dikonov).
- Dropped CA support for the old '-icam' firmware.
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Updated the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).
- Fixed a few French OSD texts that were in the wrong place.
- Improved matching timers to EPG events, especially in case there are several events
  with the same VPS time.
- Fixed cDolbyRepacker to allow recording ProSieben HD broadcasts (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Fixed cDvbDevice::SetVideoDisplayFormat() in case of 16:9 (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- The running status of a VPS event is now only taken seriously if that event has been
  seen within the last 30 seconds - otherwise recording is done as if no VPS was
  available.
- The day of a timer is now stored as a full date in ISO notation ("YYYY-MM-DD") in
  'timers.conf' and for the result of the SVDRP command LSTT (based in parts on a
  patch by Roman Krenický).
- Some fixes to avoid compiler warnings in gcc 4.0 (thanks to Ville Skyttä for reporting
  these).
- Single shot timers are now reliably deleted when they have expired.
- Fixed setting the colored button help after deleting a recording in case the next
  menu entry is a directory (thanks to Steffen Beyer).
- Improved falling back to normal recording if the VPS data hasn't been seen for more
  than 30 seconds.
- Added a missing cMutexLock to cRemote::HasKeys() (thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald).
- All log entries regarding timers now contain a short description of the timer.

2005-05-08: Version 1.3.24

- Now including the optional user defined Make.config from the 'libsi' Makefile
  (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Fixed a memory leak in tComponent (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt and Daniel Thompson).
- Fixed a memory leak in cDvbPlayer (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added missing text internationalization for "Starting EPG scan" (thanks to
  Matthias Lötzke).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling transparent areas in cDvbSpuBitmap (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Now also considering the "EPG linger time" when saving the EPG data to file or
  listing it via LSTE (thanks to Roman Krenický).
- Fixed handling fragments of less than 4 byte in cPesAssembler (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed a bug in libsi's SubtitlingDescriptor::getLength() (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler).
- When reading the channels.conf file, duplicate channels (i.e. ones that have
  the same channel ID) are now automatically deleted and only the first one is
  actually stored.
- Fixed handling lifetime when deciding whether to delete a recording (thanks to
  Udo Richter).
- Fixed timeout handling in cRwLock::Lock() (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for reporting
  this one).
- Since there are several places in thread.c where a timeout value is calculated,
  this has been put into a separate function.
- The timer status now has a new bit that is set when that timer is currently
  recording (suggested by Matthias Schniedermeyer). See man vdr(5) for details.
- Removed scaling coordinates in letterbox mode from cDvbSpu - the DVD plugin, which
  was the only one needing this, doesn't need it any more (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- No longer retuning or restarting a recording if only the language code of an
  audio or Dolby PID changes.
- Now preferring budget cards when selecting a DVB device for recording.
- Recordings now avoid zero sized video data files (thanks to Wolfgang Fitz).
- Some rearrangements in cDvbPlayer::Action() to avoid lockups on NPTL systems
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed a wrong inheritance in libsi's SubtitlingDescriptor::Subtitling (thanks to
  Marco Schlüßler).

2005-05-29: Version 1.3.25

- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Some cable providers don't mark short channel names according to the standard,
  but rather go their own way and use "name>short name". VDR now splits at this
  character for cable channels (thanks to Gerhard Steiner for reporting this one).
- Added a check for Setup.DiSEqC in cDvbDevice::ProvidesTransponder(), otherwise
  the EPG scan didn't work on systems that don't use DiSEqC (thanks to Michael
  Reinelt for reporting this one).
- Made the Makefile patch friendlier (thanks to Ludwig Nussel).
- Made cOsd::isOpen an integer counter to avoid problems with messages when a
  cOsdObject uses the raw OSD (thanks to Andreas Regel for reporting this one).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- The file 'summary.vdr' has been replaced with 'info.vdr' and now contains the
  information about a recording, in the same format as the events are stored in
  'epg.data' (see man vdr(5) for details). Existing summary files can be converted
  to the new format by running the Perl script 'summary2info.pl', as in

  summary2info.pl /video

  (the parameter given has to be the video directory). If there is no 'info.vdr'
  file for a recording, an attempt is made to read a 'summary.vdr'.
- The "Summary" button in the "Recordings" menu has been renamed to "Info", and
  the page it brings up now shows the recording's information, much like the EPG
  event page. Therefore it now no longer uses the skin's SetText() function, but
  rather the SetRecording() function. Skin plugins may need to adjust that function
  accordingly (see skinsttng.c, for instance).
- The SVDRP command LSTR now lists the recording information in the same tagged
  format as the LSTE command lists the EPG data.
- The audio track menu now contains track descriptions when replaying (provided
  such descriptions were available in the EPG data when the recording was made,
  and are stored in the info.vdr file).
- Avoiding extra blanks at the end of names of instant recordings.
- Removed converting byte order on big endian systems from cDvbOsd::Flush(),
  which, according to Johannes Stezenbach and Paavo Hartikainen, is wrong.
- Added cPlayer::DeviceSetVideoDisplayFormat() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- No longer saving the setup in case of a fatal error, to keep the volume level
  from being set to a wrong value (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed a possible hangup when ending a replay session while cIndexFile::CatchUp()
  is waiting (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- The SVDRP command DELR no longer deletes recordings that are currently being
  written to by a timer (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for pointing out this one).
- Pressing the "Play" key in live viewing mode now resumes a previous replay
  session (thanks to Mirko Dölle).
- Now dropping EPG events that have a zero start time or duration (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss).
- No longer stopping Transfer Mode or replay immediately when the Power button
  is pressed (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Moved the NPTL and UTF-8 checks after the version and help output (thanks to
  Andreas Kool for pointing out that 'vdr --version' failed on an UTF-8 system).
- Made tChannelID::operator==() inline for better performance (thanks to Georg
  Acher).
- Introduced cListBase::count for better performance (thanks to Georg Acher).
- cEvent no longer stores the channelID directly, but rather has a pointer to
  the schedule it is in.
- Now using hash tables to speed up cSchedule::GetEvent() (partially based on
  a patch from Georg Acher).
- Avoiding unnecessary calls to getLength() in libsi/si.c, and avoiding the
  '& 0xff' in CRC32::crc32() of libsi/util.c (thanks to Georg Acher).
- Speeded up deleting duplicate channels.
- Fixed listing recordings with empty episode names in the LSTR command (thanks
  to Stefan Huelswitt for pointing this out).
- Added cThread::SetPriority() and using it in cSectionHandler::Action() to
  reduce the priority of the section handler threads (as suggested by Georg Acher).

2005-06-12: Version 1.3.26

- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling 'summary.vdr' files with more than two empty lines (thanks to
  Christian Jacobsen for reporting this one).
- Improved resetting CAM connections (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Implemented cVideoRepacker in remux.c to make sure every PES packet contains
  only data from one frame (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
  NOTE: currently this doesn't work with MPEG1, so if you use MPEG1 you may want
  to change line 1158 in remux.c to

  ts2pes[numTracks++] = new cTS2PES(VPid, resultBuffer, IPACKS);

  as it was before.
- EPG events without a title now display "No title" instead of "(null)" (thanks
  to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- A device can now detach all receivers for a given PID, as is necessary, e.g.,
  for the bitstreamout plugin (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Added the year (two digits) to recording dates in LSTR, and thus also in menus
  (suggested by Jan Ekholm).
- Fixed the call to Channels.Unlock() in cEITScanner::Process() (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed handling timers with a day given as MTWTF--@6, i.e. a repeating timer with
  first day not as full date, but just day of month (thanks to Henrik Niehaus for
  reporting this one).
- Removed an unnecessary #include from osd.c (thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald).
- Fixed dropping EPG events that have a zero start time or duration, in case it's
  an NVOD event (thanks to Chris Warren).
- Fixed handling page up/down in menu lists in case there are several non selectable
  items in a row (thanks to Udo Richter for reporting this one).
- Added cOsdMenu::SetCols() to allow adjusting the menu columns.
- Modified cEITScanner::Process() so that it works on systems with only budget cards
  or a mix of DVB-S, DVB-C or DVB-T cards.

2005-06-19: Version 1.3.27

- Fixed handling 'page down', which was broken in version 1.3.26 (thanks to Udo
  Richter).
- Modified page scrolling behaviour (based on a suggestion by Patrick Gleichmann).
- The new setup option "OSD/Scroll wraps" can be used to activate wrapping around
  in menu lists (based on a suggestion by Patrick Gleichmann).
- Removed the NPTL check at startup, since several users have reported that VDR
  now runs fine with NPTL.
- Fixed handling VPS timers, so that they only record if the event they are assigned
  to actually has the given VPS time.
- Disabled cVideoRepacker in remux.c, because it has caused several problems
  during recording. If you want to test (and maybe debug) it, activate the line

  //#define TEST_cVideoRepacker

  in remux.c.
- When drawing a bitmap to the OSD, the existing palette of the target can now be
  replaced with the new one instead of adding the new entries (thanks to Andreas
  Regel).

2005-08-07: Version 1.3.28

- Added a sleep in cDvbPlayer::Action() in case there is no data to send to the
  device, which avoids a busy loop on very fast machines (thanks to Martin Wache).
- Modified the description of cDevice::Poll() to avoid misunderstandings.
- Updated Croatian language texts (thanks to Drazen Dupor).
- cDvbPlayer::Goto() now appends a Sequence End Code to get the image shown
  immediately with softdevices (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Reactivated cVideoRepacker in remux.c after some fixes (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Removed the fix for handling VPS timers, so that they only record if the event
  they are assigned to actually has the given VPS time. This has caused repeating
  VPS timers to stop recording prematurely.
- Avoiding duplicate components in EPG events when reading epg.data or in the
  PUTE SVDRP command (thanks to Olaf Titz for reporting this one).
- Added the command line options '--lirc', '--rcu' and '--no-kbd' to allow setting
  the remote control at runtime (based on a patch by Darren Salt).
- Now checking whether timers or channels are currently being edited via the menu
  before making changes through SVDRP (thanks to Andreas Brugger for reporting a
  problem with this).
- Files and directories are now created with rights according to the shell's
  umask settings (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Fixed the cChannel copy constructor (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for pointing out
  a problem with it).
- Fixed an out-of-bounds memory access with audio language ids (thanks to
  Matthias Lenk for reporting, and Udo Richter for suggesting a fix).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added missing storing of the MenuScrollPage parameter (thanks to Frank Krömmelbein).
- Added cRemux::SetTimeouts() for better use of cRemux in a single thread (thanks
  to Udo Richter for reporting a problem with this).
- Modified cEITScanner::Process() so that it uses the primary device if it is
  replaying and is the only device that provides the given transponder, and that
  a forced EPG scan works even if EPG scan timeout is set to 0 (thanks to
  Bernhard Stegmaier for reporting a problem with this).
- Fixed cDvbSpuBitmap::putPixel() (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed setting system time to avoid time jumps in case of faulty data (thanks
  to Andreas Böttger).
- Fixed a memory leak in the SVDRP command LSTE (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).

2005-08-15: Version 1.3.29

- Fixed a race condition in cTransfer (thanks to Klaus Heppenheimer for reporting this one).
  In doing so, the 'active' variables used by the actual derived cThread classes
  have been replaced by the cThread::Running() function.
  Plugin authors may want to check their derived cThread classes and replace any 'active'
  variables the same way as, for instance, done in transfer.c.
- Fixed handling EPG data for time shifted events (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Increased the default value for 'Min. user inactivity' to 300 minutes (suggested
  by Helmut Auer).
- Now storing the channel id in the info.vdr file even if there is no EPG info
  available (thanks to Andreas Brachold for reporting that there are empty info.vdr
  files created in that case).
- Added some 'mkdir -p' to the Makefile's 'install' target (thanks to Wayne Keer).
- Changed the title of the recording info menu (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling the frame number display if '7' is pressed before the first editing
  mark, or '9' after the last one (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Now discarding any previous numerical input to switch channels if Up, Down, Channel+,
  Channel-, Left or Right is pressed (thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald for reporting a
  problem with this).
- Pressing Ok while entering a channel number now immediately switches to that
  channel, without waiting for further input.
- Avoiding unnecessary OSD draw operations caused by the audio track description
  display in the ST:TNG skin's channel display (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting
  this).
- Removed the VIDEO_STILLPICTURE_WORKS_WITH_VDR_FRAMES stuff from
  cDvbDevice::StillPicture(), since apparently the VIDEO_STILLPICTURE call works.

2005-08-21: Version 1.3.30

- Improved responsiveness inside CAM menus.
- Added handling of the 'Close MMI' tag to avoid error log messages with CAMs
  that actually use it.
- Now waiting at startup until all DVB devices are ready. This includes having
  all CAMs initialized and ready to decrypt, so that no more "channel not
  available" happens if VDR is started with the current channel being an encrypted
  one, or a timer on such a channel hits right after starting VDR.
- Fixed cVideoRepacker to better handle errors in data (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed cDvbTuner to avoid lockups on NPTL systems (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Added 'Service' functions to the plugin interface (thanks to Udo Richter).
  See PLUGINS.html, section "Custom services" for details.
- Replaced the get/put_unaligned() macros from <asm/unaligned.h> with own inline
  functions to avoid problems on platforms that don't provide these (thanks to
  David Woodhouse for his help).

2005-08-28: Version 1.3.31

- Added missing German OSD texts for 'Audio language'.
- The Setup/CICAM menu now only contains the devices that actually have a CI and
  dynamically detects the number of slots a CI provides.
- Implemented cAudioRepacker for better handling of audio PES packets (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Modified handling of audio packets for radio channels in remux.c (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Fixed the EPG scan, so that it doesn't use the primary device if that is
  currently in Transfer-Mode from itself (thanks to Marcus Hilbrich for a bug
  report that lead to this).
- Removed the TUNER_LOCK_TIMEOUT in cDevice::AttachReceiver() since it caused more
  trouble than it fixed.
- Fixed detecting short channel names for "Kabel Deutschland", who uses a comma
  as delimiter (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Moved cMenuEditTimer and cMenuEvent to menu.h so that plugins can use it (suggested
  by Thomas Günther).
- The new static function cString::sprintf() can be used to easily create a formatted
  string.
- Plugins can now implement their own SVDRP commands (based on a patch from Hardy
  Flor). See PLUGINS.html, section "SVDRP commands" for details. The SVDRP commands
  of a plugin are accessed through the new SVDRP command PLUG.
  See PLUGINS/src/svdrpdemo for an example of how to use this feature.
- The new SVDRP command PLAY can be used to start replaying a recording (thanks to
  Hardy Flor).
- The new SVDRP command EDIT can be used to start the editing process of a recording
  (based on the CUTR patch by Harald Milz).

2005-09-11: Version 1.3.32

- Added some missing braces in remux.c (thanks to Wayne Keer for reporting this one).
- Removed unused MAINMENUENTRY from svdrpdemo.c (thanks to Udo Richter for reporting
  this one).
- Fixed appending sequence end code in cDvbPlayer::Goto() (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed syncing in cRepacker (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Now always using stream id 0xE0 for the video stream, to avoid problems with
  post processing tools that choke on different ids (suggested by Reinhard Nissl).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Fixed cDvbPlayer::SkipFrames() to properly handle radio recordings (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Updated the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).
- Updated the Slovenian OSD texts (thanks to Matjaz Thaler).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Made LIRC command parsing more robust (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Introduced a separate 'plugins-install' target in the Makefile (thanks to Daniel
  Thompson).
- Re-introduced the code that waits for a tuner lock in VDR/device.c, since
  apparently some users actually need it. It's not active by default, you'll have
  to define the WAIT_FOR_TUNER_LOCK macro in that file if you need it (suggested
  by Malcolm Caldwell).
- Adjusted the Makefile to the dvb-kernel driver on kernel 2.6 and up (thanks to
  Lauri Tischler).
- Repeat keys are now ignored when waiting for a keypress to cancel an operation
  (thanks to Marko Mäkelä).
- The main menu function of a plugin can now be activated through a key macro of
  the form "@plugin" even if that plugin doesn't have a main menu entry (using
  part of a patch by Hardy Flor, which originally implemented calling plugins from
  SVDRP).
- The menu timeout handling is now done centrally in the main program loop.
- Added missing help for the 'help' keyword in the SVDRP command PLUG.
- The main menu function of a plugin can now be called programmatically through
  the static function cRemote::CallPlugin().
- The SVDRP command PLUG now has a new option 'main' which can be used to initiate
  a call to the main menu function of a plugin (using part of a patch by Hardy Flor).
- The new command line option '--vfat' can be used to make VDR encode special
  characters in recording file names, even if it wasn't compiled with VFAT=1
  (suggested by Peter Bieringer). The compile time option VFAT still exists and
  creates a VDR that always behaves as if it were called with '--vfat'.
- Replaced the ':' delimiter between hour and minute in recording file names with
  a '.' under Linux, too. Existing recordings with ':' as delimiter will still work.
- Implemented the SVDRP command MOVC (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Added support for multiple audio language codes in ISO639LanguageDescriptors to
  'libsi' (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Changed the audio PID language codes to hold up to two 3 letter codes, separated
  by '+', to store separate languages broadcast in two channel audio mode.
- If the preferred audio language is broadcast on a PID that has two different
  languages in the two stereo channels, the audio channel is now properly set when
  switching to such a channel (thanks to Mogens Elneff for his help in testing this).
- Fixed some typos in MANUAL (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed the default value for "Setup/EPG bugfix level" (thanks to Ville Skyttä for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed defining timers that only differ in the day of week (thanks to Patrick
  Rother for reporting this one).
- Fixed converting summary.vdr files that would result in a very long 'short text'
  (thanks to Carsten Koch).
- Implemented a hash for the channels to reduce the system load in the EIT scanning
  thread (based on a patch by Georg Acher).

2005-09-25: Version 1.3.33

- Fixed two errors in 'newplugin' (thanks to Alexander Rieger).
- Fixed converting arbitrarily formatted summary.vdr files (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Fixed handling color buttons in cMenuEditStrItem (thanks to Alexander Rieger).
- Added cChannel::LinkChannels() and cChannel::RefChannel() (suggested by Helmut Auer).
  Note that VDR itself doesn't actually use the linked channels, yet, so there is
  no guarantee that this really works under all circumstances.
- Added a missing include statement to the 'sky' plugin (thanks to Alfred Zastrow
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling key macros with keys after @plugin (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed error handling in cCiTransportConnection::RecvTPDU() (thanks to Georg Acher
  for reporting this one).
- Removed obsolete 'shift' code in device.[hc].
- The SVDRP command DELR no longer triggers a complete reload of the global Recordings
  list, but rather deletes that particular entry.
- The list of recordings is now read in a separate thread, resulting in a faster
  startup if there are a great many of recordings, or the disk(s) have to spin up.
  If the Recordings menu is opened while the list of recordings is still being read,
  the menu will be updated accordingly.
  Plugins that access the global Recordings variable should lock the thread
  by putting something like

    cThreadLock RecordingsLock(&Recordings);

  into the respective code block. Thanks to Carsten Koch for his help in testing
  and debugging this.
- The 'new' indicator in the Recordings menu is now kept up-to-date (thanks to
  Thomas Günther).
- Updated the Romanian OSD texts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- The '.update' file in the video directory is now touched when a recording is
  added or deleted, so that other VDR instances can update their lists (thanks to
  Alexander Rieger).
- Made the function ExchangeChars() public (suggested by Lucian Muresan).

2005-10-03: Version 1.3.34

- Fixed a leftover 'summary.vdr' in vdr.5 (thanks to Peter Bieringer for reporting
  this one).
- Fixed opening recording folders in case the last replayed recording no longer
  exists (reported by Udo Richter).
- Fixed an unjustified "Error while accessing recording!" after deleting a recording
  from a subfolder.
- Fixed handling the '.update' file in case the video directory is not at the default
  location (reported by Jon Burgess).
- Fixed a crash in cConfig::Load() when compiling on the PPC (thanks to Sascha
  Volkenandt).
- Fixed the FATALERRNO macro to check for a non-zero errno value (reported by Marco
  Schlüßler).
- Added a check against MAXOSDAREAS in cOsd::CanHandleAreas() (reported by Udo
  Richter).
- Fixed setting current menu item if the first one is non-selectable.
- cOsdItem::cOsdItem() now has a 'Selectable' parameter.
- Improved displaying 'sub-title' and 'bottom text' in the CAM menu.
- Added status message "Resetting CAM..." for an immediate feedback when the CAM
  reset has been triggered.
- The CAM menu now automatically updates itself in case of a progress display (as
  used, for instance, when updating the firmware via satellite).
- Now skipping some funny characters sent by some CAMs at the beginning of strings.
- The CAM menu is now completely closed when pressing the Menu key while inside
  a sub menu.
- Reduced MAX_CONNECT_RETRIES in ci.c to 2 (waiting too long made the whole thing
  appear hanging).
- Added status message "Opening CAM menu..." for an immediate feedback when the CAM
  menu has been requested.
- Speeded up initial opening of the CAM menu.
- Fixed handling of menus with no selectable items.
- The character 0x8A in CAM menu strings is now mapped to a real newline.
- The 'sub-title' and 'bottom text' in the CAM menu can now consist of several lines.
- Improved the CAM enquiry menu.

2005-10-31: Version 1.3.35

- Updated 'sources.conf' (thanks to Philip Prindeville).
- Now using daemon() instead of fork() to run VDR in daemon mode (thanks to
  Enrico Scholz).
- Fixed a possible endless loop in a menu with no selectable items if
  Setup.MenuScrollWrap is true (thanks to Enrico Scholz).
- Making sure no item is displayed as "current" if Up, Down, Left or Right is
  pressed in a menu with no selectable items.
- Added '__attribute__' to functions that use printf() like parameters (thanks
  to Darren Salt).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed a leftover 'summary.vdr' in vdr.1 (reported by Christoph Hermanns).
- Added more error messages and line numbers when reading EPG data and info.vdr
  (thanks to Peter Bieringer).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Added missing mutex locks to cCiMenu::Abort() and cCiEnquiry::Abort() (reported
  by Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed lock handling in CAM communication to avoid problems with multiple CAMs
  per device or CAMs with more than one smart card.
- Updated the Greek OSD texts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Updated the French OSD texts (thanks to Nicolas Huillard).
- Fixed the cFilter example in PLUGINS.html (reported by Patrick Fischer).
- The new class cUnbufferedFile is used for the recording files to avoid
  trashing the file system cache (based on a patch by Ralf Müller).

2005-11-06: Version 1.3.36

- Fixed a NULL pointer access with the cUnbufferedFile when a replay session runs
  all the way until the end of the recording (thanks to Joachim Wilke).
- A menu is no longer automatically closed when a replay ends (reported by
  Marko Mäkelä).
- Removed '\n' from several syslog() calls (reported by Sascha Volkenandt).
- Fixed missing '&' in the SetAreas() example in PLUGINS.html (reported by
  Sascha Volkenandt).
- Fixed a memory leak in cString::operator=() (reported by Sascha Volkenandt).
- Updated the Dutch OSD texts (thanks to Maarten Wisse).
- cReadLine now dynamically allocates its buffer, so that it can handle lines
  of any length.
- Changed cConfig::Load() to use cReadLine instead of a fixed buffer (thanks
  to Andreas Mair for reporting a problem with extremely long summary fields
  in timers).
- cSVDRP now dynamically allocates its command buffer in order to handle
  commands of any length. The MAXPARSEBUFFER macro is now obsolete and has
  been removed. If a plugin has used that macro, it should either define
  a buffer size of its own, or use cReadLine when reading files.
- Fixed a race condition in the SPU decoder (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- The EPG scan no longer disturbs players that have also set live PIDs
  (reported by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed setting the help key display in the Recordings menu in case of several
  layers of subdirectories.
- Removed EPG bugfix #0, because it removed actually important data.

2005-11-27: Version 1.3.37

- Added compiler options "-fPIC -g" to all plugins (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed initializing the day index when editing the weekday parameter of a
  repeating timer (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- No longer removing superfluous hyphens in EPG data - would become too
  language dependent to handle all kinds of exceptions.
- Modified switching to Dolby Digital audio in live mode, if the driver
  and firmware can handle live DD without the need of a Transfer Mode (thanks
  to Werner Fink). Live DD mode requires a full featured DVB card and a
  LinuxDVB driver with firmware version 0x2622 or higher. Older versions will
  use Transfer Mode just like before.
- Implemented handling of the "CA PMT Reply" for CAMs (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler for figuring out some obscure length bytes in the CA PMT Reply
  data of AlphaCrypt CAMs).
- Some preparations for being able to record several encrypted channels from
  the same transponder at the same time (or record and view different encrypted
  channels), provided the CAM in use can handle this. This is work in progress
  and isn't actively used, yet.
- Fixed SetProgress() in the 'skincurses' plugin in case Total is 0 (reported
  by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added a copy constructor to cString and fixed its assignment operator
  (thanks to Holger Brunn).
- The new function Skins.QueueMessage() can be called from a background thread
  to queue a message for display. See VDR/skins.h for details.
- The SVDRP command MESG uses the new message queuing facility, so MESG
  commands may now be executed at any time, and the message will be displayed
  (no more "pending message").

2006-01-08: Version 1.3.38

- Fixed handling second audio and Dolby Digital PIDs for encrypted channels
  (was broken in version 1.3.37).
- Improved TS/PES conversion to better handle lost TS packets (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Limited the frequency of log messages from the cRepackers.
- Now using the gettid() syscall to get a thread's pid, so that we get a
  useful value on NPTL systems (suggested by Johannes Stezenbach).
- Fixed the RCU remote control handling to avoid problems with NPTL (thanks
  to Andreas Share for reporting a lockup with the RCU on NPTL systems).
- When displaying the amount of free disk space, the space consumed by
  recordings that have been "deleted" but not yet actually "removed" is now
  taken into account (suggested by Christian Vogt).
- Now avoiding unnecessary disk access when checking if there are deleted
  recordings that need to be removed (reported by Carsten Koch).
- Fixed handling the DELETEDLIFETIME when removing deleted recordings. Now
  a deleted recording is retained at least DELETEDLIFETIME seconds before
  actually removing it.
  The value of DELETEDLIFETIME has been changed to 300. So after (possibly
  inadvertently) deleting a recording, there will be at least 5 minutes
  in which it can be recovered (unless a new recording immediately requires
  the disk space). The count starts again at 0 every time VDR is started.
- Fixed a possible crash when displaying the "Low disk space!" message from
  a background thread (thanks to Christof Steininger).
- Fixed handling OSD areas that have invalid sizes (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Added a mutex to AssertFreeDiskSpace() to make sure calls from foreground
  and background threads won't interfere.
- The main menu now dynamically updates its contents in case an instant
  recording or replay stops, etc.
- The version number of EPG events is now also stored in the epg.data file
  (thanks to Kendy Kutzner).
- EPG events that are no longer in the currently broadcasted data stream are
  now automatically deleted.
- Removed an invalid access to Event->schedule in cSchedule::DelEvent().
- Modified cSchedule::Cleanup() (events are always sorted by time).
- Schedules are now cleaned up once every hour (not only at 05:00).
- The "Schedule" and "What's on now/next?" menus are now updated if a timer
  is set or modified.
- cTimer no longer has its own 'schedule' member, it rather uses that of the
  event it has been set to.
- The "Red" button in the "Schedule", "What's on now/next?" and "Event" menus
  now immediately creates a timer for the selected event and marks it with 'T'.
  If the event is already marked with 'T', the "Red" button opens the "Edit
  timer" menu for that timer.
- Removing deleted recordings is now done in a separate thread.
- Dropped the unused "stop recording on primary interface" stuff.
- Converting a grabbed image to JPEG is now done with the new function
  RgbToJpeg() (see tools.h).
- The SVDRP command GRAB now determines the image type (JPEG or PNM) from the
  extension (".jpg", ".jpeg" or ".pnm") of the given file name. The explicit
  'jpeg' or 'pnm' parameter is still accepted for backward compatibility, but
  has no meaning any more.
- The function cDevice::GrabImage() no longer writes the grabbed image to a
  file, but rather returns a pointer to the image in memory. The wrapper
  function cDevice::GrabImageFile() can be used to write the grabbed image
  directly to a file. Plugins that used the old version of cDevice::GrabImage()
  need to be adapted to the new interface.
- The new class cBase64Encoder (see tools.h) can be used to encode data in
  base64 (thanks to Bob Withers for publishing his Base64 class).
- The SVDRP command GRAB now writes the image data to the SVDRP connection
  (encoded in base64) if the given file name consists of only the file
  extension (".jpg", ".jpeg" or ".pnm"), or if only "-" is given as file
  name (based on a suggestion from Darren Salt).
  A simple way of viewing a grabbed image on a remote host is:

  svdrpsend.pl -d <hostname> 'grab -' | sed -n -e 's/^216-//p' -e '1ibegin-base64 644 -' -e '$a====' | uudecode | display -

- The new command line option '-g' must be given if the SVDRP command GRAB
  shall be allowed to write image files to disk. The parameter to this option
  must be the full path name of an existing directory, without any "..", double
  '/' or symlinks. By default, or if "-g- is given, grabbing to files is
  not allowed any more because of potential security risks.
- Modified the way the SVDRP command GRAB writes the grabbed image to a file
  to avoid a security hole (CAN-2005-0071, reported by Javier Fernández-Sanguino
  Peña):
  + The file handle is now opened in a way that it won't follow symbolic links
    (suggested by Darren Salt).
  + The given file name is now canonicalized, so that it won't contain any
    ".." or symlinks (suggested by Darren Salt).
  + Grabbing to files is limited to the directory given in the the command
    line option '-g'. By default grabbing to files is not allowed any more.
- Updated the Greek OSD texts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Changed all "illegal" to "invalid" in error messages (there's nothing "illegal"
  in VDR ;-).
- When started as user 'root' VDR now switches to a lesser privileged user id,
  keeping the capability to set the system time (based on a patch from Ludwig
  Nussel). By default the user id 'vdr' is used, which can be changed through
  the new command line option '-u'. Note that for security reasons VDR will no
  longer run as user 'root' (unless you explicitly start it with '-u root',
  but this is not recommended!). The 'runvdr' script has been changed to
  use the '-u' option.
- Changed the API of the functions cStatus::Recording() and cStatus::Replaying(),
  so that they can provide the full file name of the recording. Plugins that use
  these (or the related cStatus::Msg...() functions) need to be adapted
  (suggested by Andreas Brugger).
- The DVB devices now retune (and, if applicable, resend the DiSEqC data) if
  the lock is lost (based on a patch from Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed handling multi byte key sequences in cKbdRemote (based on a patch from
  Jürgen Schneider).
- Removed unused variables in skinclassic.c and skinsttng.c (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler).
- Made the static cControl functions thread safe (thanks to Patrick Fischer).
- Fixed initializing pthread_mutexattr_t and pthread_rwlockattr_t to avoid
  warnings with g++ 4.1.0 (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed incrementing the 'state' variables in the repacker classes in remux.c
  to avoid warnings with g++ 4.1.0 (reported by Ville Skyttä).
- The Makefile now reports a summary of failed plugins (thanks to Udo Richter).
- The cTimer constructor can now take an optional cChannel (suggested by
  Patrick Fischer).
- Fixed setting the main thread id if VDR is running as a daemon.
- Fixed handling TS packets in cTS2PES (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Added cTimer::SetPriority() to set a timer's priority (suggested by Kendy Kutzner).
- Added cMenuEditStrItem::InEditMode() (suggested by Christian Wieninger).
- Now using FE_READ_STATUS to read the current frontend status (suggested by
  Holger Wächtler).
- The "Menu" key now behaves consistently. If there is anything on the OSD, it
  is closed when the "Menu" key is pressed, and if there is nothing on the OSD,
  the "Menu" key opens the main menu (suggested by Luca Olivetti).
- The new option "Setup/OSD/Timeout requested channel info" can be used to turn
  off the automatic timeout of the channel display in case it was invoked by
  a press of the "Ok" key (suggested by Thiemo Gehrke).
- A message is now given when an instant recording is started (suggested by
  Helmut Auer). Actually the code was already there, just commented out - don't
  remember why it wasn't active...
- Removed an obsolete "Summary" text from i18n.c and preceded all key definition
  texts with "Key$" to avoid duplicates (reported by Lucian Muresan).
- Preceded all button texts with "Button$".
- Removed obsolete "Eject", "Language" and "scanning recordings..." texts.
- Added missing #include "thread.h" to dvbspu.c (reported by Gavin Hamill).
- Disabled the use of "fadvise" in cUnbufferedFile because there have been
  several reports that it causes more problems than it solves (suggested by
  Petri Hintukainen). If you want to use "fadvise", you can activate the line
  //#define USE_FADVISE
  in tools.c.
- Removed unused 'offset' member from cOsdItem.
- In the "Channels" menu the numeric keys now position the cursor to the channel
  with the given number (see MANUAL, section "Remote Control Keys", note (3) for
  details).
- The "Mark/Move" function in the "Channels" menu now also works in the non-numeric
  sort modes.
- The default cOsdObject::Show() now automatically calls cOsdMenu::Display() if
  this is a menu.
- The new "Info" key brings up information on the currently viewed programme
  or recording. For a live programme this is the same as "Schedule/Ok", i.e. the
  description of the current EPG event. For a recording this is the same as shown
  by the "Info" button in the "Recordings" menu. Plugins that implement players
  can overwrite their cControl::GetInfo() function to show their own info (see
  PLUGINS.html for details). Pressing the "Info" key again while the info is
  displayed will close the OSD. In order to assign this new key to an existing
  remote control setup, the remote.conf file needs to be deleted and VDR has
  to be restarted to go through the process of learning the remote control keys.
- Any cReceivers still attached to a cDevice when that device switches to a
  different transponder are now automatically detached (suggested by Patrick
  Fischer).
- The "flags" of a timer are now handled as an unsigned integer value. In order
  to do this, the interface of cMenuEditBitItem also had to be changed.
- In string entry fields (like, e.g., the file name of a recording) the characters
  can now be entered by pressing the numeric keys, the same way as on a
  telephone keypad (based on the "Easy Input" patch from Marcel Schaeben).
- Fixed the "Day" field of the "Edit timer" menu when pressing '0' to switch
  from "single shot" to "weekly", followed by the "Right" key (reported by
  Andreas Böttger).
- The file 'ca.conf' is obsolete and has been removed.
- Revised all descriptions regarding CICAM.
- Adapted c(Dvb)Device::ProvidesCa() to the dynamic CA handling.
- Added a mutex to synchronize cDevice::PlayPesPacket() and SetCurrentAudioTrack()
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Added a SleepMs() in cRecorder::Action() to avoid a busy loop (thanks to Ingo
  Schneider).
- Cleaned up some trailing white space.

2006-01-15: Version 1.3.39

- The SVDRP command LSTT now accepts the new option 'id' to have the channels
  of the timers listed with their unique channel ids instead of their numbers
  (suggested by Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- Added a missing #include <linux/unistd.h> to thread.c (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed the "plugins-clean" and "plugins-install" targets in the Makefile (thanks
  to Andreas Brachold).
- Fixed handling "more than 3 byte" key sequences in cKbdRemote::ReadKeySequence()
  (thanks to Peter Bieringer). If you are using the PC keyboard as remote control
  input you may need to make VDR newly learn the keys by removing the remote.conf
  file.
- To avoid problems with access rights when VDR shall run as 'root' it now skips
  all SetCaps() and SetUser() calls when it is started as 'root' and "-u root"
  is given.
- Added missing i18n entry for the "Timer" button (thanks to Ville Skyttä)
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Making the "Menu" key behave consistently has not been well received by several
  users, so the new option "Setup/OSD/Menu button closes" can be used to get the
  old behavior back (which also is the default value of this option).
- Dropped the default vdr user. The program now always runs under the user id
  it was started from, unless the '-u' option is given and it was started from
  the 'root' user. If you want to have a default vdr user, you can activate and
  adjust the "VDR_USER = vdr" line in your Make.config file (from the original
  patch by Ludwig Nussel).
- Key macros can now be defined for all non-modeless keys (suggested by Mirko Dölle).
- Adjusted the "KEY MACROS" section of vdr.5 to the new plugin calling mechanism
  introduced in version 1.3.32.
- Removed the now obsolete "ca.conf" section from vdr.1 (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Added missing description of L and R circular polarization to 'diseqc.conf'.
- Added a note about "modprobe capability" to INSTALL (suggested by Patrick Cernko).
- Fixed canonicalizing the file name in the SVDRP command GRAB to allow full path
  names (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added a missing '-' to the example for viewing a grabbed image on a remote host
  (reported by Philippe Gramoullé).
- Made the "What's on now/next?" menus a lot faster by storing a pointer to each
  channel's schedule in the cChannel data.
- Made the log messages regarding lost lock of devices "info" instead of "error"
  (suggested by Andreas Brachold).
- The SVDRP command GRAB allows file names without extension again (suggested by
  Stefan Huelswitt).
- Pressing '0' in the "Schedule" menu now rotates through displaying "This event on
  this channel", "This event on all channels" and "All events on all channels".
  This can be used to find reruns of a given show, or the episodes of a series.
  Note that if there are many channels in your channels.conf, displaying the
  "All events on all channels" page may take a while.
- The status markers in the "Schedule" menu are now only updated if a submenu is
  closed in which a timer has been modified, which speeds up closing submenus.
- Now only writing Dolby Digital tracks into the 'info.vdr' file of a recording
  if Setup.UseDolbyDigital is true (suggested by André Weidemann).
- Added a leading '0' to the day in the DayDateTime() function (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- No longer displaying color buttons in the recording info menu if it has been
  invoked from a player (reported by Jürgen Schilling).

2006-01-22: Version 1.3.40

- Fixed a second place where a message should be given when an instant recording
  is started (reported by Jesus Bravo Alvarez).
- Modified logging so that even on NPTL systems each line in the log file shows
  the individual thread's pid (based on a suggestion from Francois-Xavier Kowalski).
- Fixed a problem with @plugin in keymacros.conf in case the named plugin is not
  loaded (reported by Franz Gangkofer).
- Fixed a crash after executing the SVDRP command CLRE, caused by dangling 'schedule'
  pointers from cChannel objects (reported by Malte Schröder).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Improved NULL checking in strreplace().
- Fixed a crash in the Schedule menu with events that have no title (reported by
  Rolf Ahrenberg). cEvent::FixEpgBugs() now assigns a "No title" string to events
  that have no title.
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Recordings are now only started if there is at least 300MB free disk space
  (suggested by Markus Hahn).
- When entering text via the numeric keys, the cursor now automatically advances
  (based on a patch from Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Updated the Polish OSD texts and the fontosd-iso8859-2.c file (thanks to Jaroslaw
  Swierczynski).
- Disabled the "buffer reserve" in Transfer Mode. Last chance to complain if you
  really need it - it will be completely removed in the next version. If you are
  experiencing problems with a/v running out of sync, try the latest driver and
  firmware (if you are using a full featured DVB card).
- Switching channels with the Up/Down or Channel+/Channel- keys now works a lot
  faster when the repeat function kicks in, by not actually switching the
  channel every time, but rather only displaying the channel info and doing
  the final switch when the key is released.
- The channel display is now updated _before_ the channel is switched.
- Added a missing initialization of 'timeout' in the cDisplayChannel constructor.
- Fixed detecting if there can be any useful further input when entering channel
  numbers (thanks to Thomas Bergwinkl).
- Updated the Spanish OSD texts (thanks to Jesus Bravo Alvarez).
- Fixed handling the '0' key for switching between the last two channels (thanks
  to Thomas Bergwinkl).

2006-01-29: Version 1.3.41

- EPG events from epg.data or SVDRP's PUTE command now have their Title set to
  "No Title" if none was set.
- Fixed checking toFile in cCuttingThread::Action() (found in a larger patch from
  Artur Skawina).
- Fixed a crash when pressing '0' in the "Schedule" menu on a channel that doesn't
  have any EPG data (reported ny Alexander Hans).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Fixed a missing ',' in the Greek OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Fixed handling the tfRecording flag when reading timers (bug reported by Andreas
  Mair).
- Now checking whether the channel exists before setting the PMT filter in
  cPatFilter::Process() (thanks to Thomas Bergwinkl).
- Now trying to reestablish the connection to the LIRC daemon in case it breaks
  (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed channel switching with the Down (Up) key in case the current channel is
  already the first (last) in the list (reported by Frank Krömmelbein).
- Removed the "buffer reserve" in Transfer Mode - it's no longer necessary with
  recent driver/firmware versions.
- The epg.data file is now written when VDR exits (suggested by Daniel Karsubka).
- Fixed cTimers::GetNextActiveTimer() so that it won't return an expired timer
  (reported by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Changed DVBS_TUNE_TIMEOUT and DVBC_TUNE_TIMEOUT to 9000ms to avoid problems with
  channels that have low symbol rates (reported by Suur Karu).
- Fixed displaying the current audio track in the channel display.
- When reading epg.data (or data from PUTE), the version number of events with
  table IDs smaller than 0x50 is now ignored because otherwise the current
  running status would not be set after a restart of VDR.
- Implemented a timeout for remote controls that don't deliver "repeat" keypresses
  very fast (based on a suggestion by Luca Olivetti; problem with the new handling
  of k_Repeat keypresses in channel switching reported by Udo Richter).
- When looking for the present or following EPG event, the running status is now
  always taken into account.
- Now initializing the channels' schedule pointers when reading the epg.data file,
  so that the first WhatsOn menu will come up faster.
- If a shutdown is requested, but the shutdown script doesn't actually halt the
  system, it is now tried again after 5 minutes (suggested by Helmut Auer).
- Separated the 'install' target into several individual targets; renamed the
  'plugins-install' target to 'install-plugins' (thanks to Helmut Auer).

2006-02-05: Version 1.3.42

- Removed leftover 'needsBufferReserve' variable from cTransfer (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler).
- Fixed setting "No title" for broken event data (reported by Ronny Kornexl).
- Fixed channel up/down switching on single card systems (reported by Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Fixed handling "pending" timers that blocked others that actually could record
  (reported by Thomas Koch).
- Speeded up cVideoRepacker (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Added an 'Id' parameter to cDevice::PlayAudio() to allow plugins to easier
  process the audio data (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Added Czech language texts (thanks to Vladimír Bárta).
  Plugin authors may want to add the new entries to their I18N texts and contact
  the translators to have their texts translated. Note that there are now 21
  different OSD languages, so please make sure you have 21 versions for each of
  your texts.
- Updated the Polish OSD texts (thanks to Jaroslaw Swierczynski).
- Fixed auto advance in string entry fields when pressing Up/Down in insert mode
  (reported by Udo Richter).
- Fixed handling the "Setup/OSD/Menu button closes" option when set to 'yes' in
  case a replay is active (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Improved cUnbufferedFile; USE_FADVISE is now defined in tools.c by default, so
  if you don't want to use "fadvise" you need to comment out that line (thanks to
  Artur Skawina).
- Fixed a missing ',' in the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- cDevice::Transferring() can now be used to determine whether the (primary)
  device is currently playing in Transfer Mode (based on a suggestion by
  Reinhard Nissl).
- The 'runvdr' script no longer uses the $VDRUSR environment variable to set
  the user id under which 'vdr' shall run. Just add the '-u username' option
  when you call 'runvdr'.
- Fixed multiple entries of the same subdirectory in the "Recordings" menu
  (reported by Christian Jacobsen).
- Enabled generating a core dump if VDR is run with a different user id (thanks
  to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed handling the "Blue" key in the "Schedule" menu for the current channel
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Renamed the Makefile target 'plugins-clean' to 'clean-plugins' (suggested by
  Sebastian Frei).
- Made all font and image data 'const' (thanks to Darren Salt).
- Fixed scrolling with Up/Down in case there are non-selectable items at the
  beginning or end of the menu (reported by Helmut Auer).
- Added cSkin::GetTextAreaWidth() and cSkin::GetTextAreaFont(), so that a plugin
  that wants to do special text formatting can do so (thanks to Alexander Rieger).

2006-02-19: Version 1.3.43

- Removed an unnecessary toFile->SetReadAhead() from cutter.c (thanks to Artur
  Skawina).
- The "Back" key now restores the original string when pressed while editing a
  string item (suggested by Markus Hahn).
- Now stopping scanning the video directory if there are too many levels of
  symbolic links, which might indicate a recursive link loop (based on a patch
  from Helmut Auer).
- Improved OSD area handling in cDvbSpuDecoder (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Now logging the description (if present) in case a thread is canceled (suggested
  by Marco Schlüßler).
- cMenuText now uses the given font (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The ST:TNG skin now uses the fixed font if requested when displaying texts.
- Fixed some typos in the CONTRIBUTORS file (thanks to Frank Krömmelbein).
- Changed offset and size handling in 'libsi' from 'unsigned' to 'signed', so that
  overflows can be better detected (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Checking data size in CaDescriptor::Parse() and LinkageDescriptor::Parse() of
  'libsi' to avoid crashes with invalid data (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- Made CharArray::DataOwnData::assign() in 'libsi' more robust against invalid
  data (suggested by Oliver Endriss). Also changed CharArray::DataOwnData::Delete()
  so that it sets 'size' and 'data' to 0.
- Now resetting the channel number if the number entered through the numeric keys
  exceeds the maximum channel number (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The language code in the 'X' component records of EPG data can now consist of
  two codes, separated by '+'.
- If a recording starts and there is no EPG data available for the recorded channel,
  the 'X' audio component records for the 'info.vdr' file are now generated from the
  channel's PID data.
- Externally provided EPG data (with table ID 0x00) now gets its component
  descriptors set from the broadcast data, so that language codes and descriptions
  are available (suggested by Andreas Brugger).
- When setting the audio track descriptions, the language codes are now also set
  in case this is a replay session (based on a patch from Rolf Ahrenberg).
- If a recording starts and the channel's audio PID data has more language code
  information than the EPG's component data, the code from the channel is taken.
- Fixed handling DPID when deciding whether to switch to 'Transfer Mode' (thanks
  to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed replaying recordings of radio channels with many audio tracks (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Added a comment to tChannelID::nid, explaining that is is actually the "original"
  network id.

2006-02-26: Version 1.3.44

- Fixed setting the audio language codes in 'Transfer-Mode' (reported by Rolf
  Ahrenberg). The actual problem was the call to the Transferring() function in
  cDevice::AttachPlayer() before assigning the player.
- Fixed removing the '-' when entering a channel number where there is no other
  one that fits the input (thanks to Joachim Wilke).
- Fixed the 'libsi' function CharArray::checkSize(), which made a previous workaround
  in libsi/descriptor.c obsolete (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg).
- The "Ok" key in the "Jump" mode of the replay progress display now confirms the
  jump instead of closing the display (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- The 'summary' field of a timer definition has been renamed to 'aux', and is now
  only used for external applications to store auxiliary information with a timer,
  which has no meaning whatsoever to VDR itself.
  The contents of the 'aux' field of a timer is copied into the recording's
  'info.vdr' file, using the tag character '@'.
- The description of a recording is now taken exclusively from its related EPG
  data. If an application wants to use a different description it needs to set
  it with SVDRP/PUTE and use table ID 0x00, so that it won't be overwritten (as
  a side effect, however, this also disables VPS for such an event).
- There is no more "Summary" menu when pressing "Ok" in the "Timers" menu.
  The "Ok" key now always opens the "Edit timer" menu.
- The upper 16 bit of a timer's "flags" are no longer treated specially when a timer
  is modified in the "Edit timer" menu. If an external application needs to know if
  a timer was modified, it has to keep a copy of the timer's data and compare that
  to the actual data.
- The new function cRecordingInfo::ChannelID() can be used to retrieve the ID of
  the channel a recording was made from.
- The 'info.vdr' file of a recording now also contains the 'E' and 'V' records of
  the EPG event used when creating it.
- The option "Setup/OSD/Sort timers" has been removed. Timers are always sorted
  by their start time and priority.
- The "Blue" key in the "Timers" menu now displays the EPG info of the event the
  selected timer will record (if available). The "On/Off" function has been shifted
  to the "Red" button. Editing a timer is done by pressing "Ok".
- When determining which event a timer is going to record, all available events
  in the future are now taken into account (no more limit to 4 hours in the
  future). This has been done so that the event info is available in the "Timers"
  menu when pressing the "Blue" button. In order to avoid unnecessary work, each
  timer now has its own timestamp to control whether its schedule has changed
  since the last time its event has been set.
- Fixed setting events to timers in case a non-VPS event has expired.
- There is now a log message "timer ... set to event ..." when defining a timer
  from the EPG menu.
- Lines tagged with '#' in the 'info.vdr' file of a recording are now silently
  ignored when reading that file (suggested by Peter Bieringer). Such lines can
  be used by external tools to store arbitrary information.
- The 'event id' in EPG data has been extended to 32 bit, so that external tools
  can generate ids that don't collide with those from the DVB data stream
  (suggested by Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- The DrawBitmap() function now has a new parameter 'Overlay' that allows a bitmap
  to be drawn with a transparent background (thanks to Alexander Hans).
- Fixed cSchedule::GetFollowingEvent() in case there is currently no present event
  running (thanks to Pekka Mauno).

2006-03-26: Version 1.3.45

- Fixed updating the "Info" button in the "Timers" menu.
- Reduced the number of events to actually check when setting events to timers.
- cMenuEditIntItem now checks the given value and forces it to be between the
  given min and max limits.
- The status changes of EPG events are now logged for all channels that have timers.
- Removed the log message "deleting plugin: ..." when shutting down VDR (thanks to
  Christoph Haubrich for reporting that this is irritating when calling "vdr --help").
- Fixed cReadLine::Read() for lines that end with the infamous "\r\n" (thanks to
  Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed cDvbDevice::SetAudioBypass() in case setTransferModeForDolbyDigital is false
  (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Updated 'sources.conf' (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Fixed the shutdown timeout (thanks to Alexander Wenzel).
- Only calling RemoveEmptyVideoDirectories() once in case a recording has been
  deleted (reported by Hardy Flor).
- Fixed deleting recordings that have been removed externally when running out of
  disk space (reported by Jan Lenz).
- Fixed handling repeating VPS timers (they stopped recording too early).
- Timer log messages now show "VPS" if this is a VPS timer.
- Fixed getting the present EPG event in case none is currently 'running' (it
  then returns the one that just ended).
- Fixed calling a plugin's main menu function while a message is being displayed
  (reported by Helmut Auer).
- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Made cMenuRecordings::GetRecording() 'protected' (suggested by Marius Heidenstecker).
- Speeded up cRemux::ScanVideoPacket() (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Enhanced logging EPG event data.
- Fixed format string handling (thanks to Darren Salt).
- The new function cDevice::ForceTransferMode() can be used to force the primary
  device into transfer mode (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- The 'version' of EPG events is now ignored when reading EPG data from 'epg.data'
  or via SVDRP/PUTE to avoid problems with double EPG events.
- The 'running status' of EPG events is now only set to SI::RunningStatusNotRunning
  for events before the present event.
- Fixed some #include sequences.
- Single shot VPS timers are now only considered 'expired' if their associated
  EPG event has been explicitly set to SI::RunningStatusNotRunning.
- The check for timers to be deleted is now done only every 30 seconds.

2006-04-09: Version 1.3.46

- Fixed handling broken PMT records (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for pointing out how
  to detect these).
- Added a missing "Button$" for the Timer button and "Key$" in skinclassic.c
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed broken entry 'A111.1W' in sources.conf (reported by Luca Olivetti).
- Replaced the obsolete entry 'S21.5E' in the default 'diseqc.conf' with 'S13.0E'
  (reported by Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed learning keys when VDR is already running (thanks to Jurij Retzlaff).
- Fixed handling the system time transponder setting in the Setup/EPG menu, which
  was broken by the min/max fix in cMenuEditIntItem.
- VPS timers now record only events that have exactly the given start time.
  This fix also implements recording several subsequent events that have the
  same VPS time (like a sports event with intermittent news breaks).
- When checking for timers that have entered the "VPS margin", any free devices are
  now used to switch to the needed transponder. This improves cases where more than
  one VPS timer is about to start.
- Fixed handling the VPS margin in case the event's duration is shorter than the
  margin.
- Fixed handling VPS timers in case the primary device needs to switch to the
  timer's transponder.
- Now avoiding the 'actual' device when starting a recording, so that a Transfer
  Mode for live tv isn't interrupted.
- Fixed a typo in skins.h (thanks to Alexander Rieger).
- cSkins::QueueMessage() called from a background thread with an empty message
  now clears all messages that have been previously queued by that thread and have
  not yet been displayed (thanks to Alexander Rieger).
- Fixed handling the color button texts when switching from the 'Schedule' menu of
  a channel without EPG info to the 'What's on now' menu (reported by Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- cMenuEditIntItem and cMenuEditChanItem can now be given strings to label the
  minimum and maximum values, and the case that no channel has been selected,
  respectively.
- The initial channel and volume can now be defined in the "Setup/Miscellaneous"
  menu (based on a patch from Thomas Keil).
- When hitting the end of a recording in fast forward mode, VDR no longer switches
  back to normal speed if the recording is already finished (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- No longer calling cPlugin::ProcessArgs() if VDR is run with the --help or
  --version option, to avoid error messages from plugins (reported by Udo Richter).
- Now checking whether there is any text before calling cStatus::MsgOsdTextItem()
  (reported by Joachim Wilke).

2006-04-17: Version 1.3.47

- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed a crash when setting the time transponder in the Setup menu, caused by the
  new 'noneString' in cMenuEditChanItem (reported by Thomas Günther).
- Added NULL checks to some strdup() calls in menuitems.c (suggested by Darren
  Salt).
- Removed the unnecessary 'value' member from cMenuEditItem.
- Fixed the initial setting of the time transponder setup parameter (reported
  by Thomas Günther).
- Fixed unnecessary Set() calls in cMenuEditIntItem::ProcessKey().
- Allowing a tolerance for symbol rate values that are off by one (thanks to
  Richard Lithvall).
- Added VBITeletextDescriptorTag, TeletextDescriptorTag, LocalTimeOffsetDescriptorTag
  and PremiereContentTransmissionDescriptor to 'libsi' (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Using geteuid() to check whether VDR is running as user 'root' (suggested by
  Tobias Grimm).
- Added a missing "Key$" in skincurses.c (reported by Darren Salt).
- Reintroduced the log message "deleting plugin: ..." when shutting down VDR (upon
  request by Ville Skyttä, as in the initial patch from Christoph Haubrich).
- Fixed the vdr.1 man page (a single DVB card can record and do live tv).
- The preferred audio language is now automatically selected when starting replay.
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- The new function cPlugin::Active() can be used by a plugin to indicate that it
  is still busy and the system should not shut down or restart (based on a patch
  from Sascha Volkenandt). See PLUGINS.html for details.
- Fixed setting the 'Delta' parameter when calling the shutdown script with
  no active timer (reported by Helge Lenz).
- In order to make sure that plugins are compiled with the same DVB driver header
  files as VDR itself, the definition of DVBDIR has been removed from the VDR
  Makefile. If you are using a driver version that has its header files at a location
  other than /usr/include/linux/dvb, you can define DVBDIR in the Make.config
  file (see also INSTALL). Note that if you already have a Make.config file of your
  own, you should add the lines

  ifdef DVBDIR
  INCLUDES += -I$(DVBDIR)/include
  endif

  to its end, as in the new Make.config.template.
  Any reference to DVBDIR should be removed from all plugins' Makefiles, like this:

- Implemented kNext and kPrev keys (based on a patch from Peter Juszack).
  See MANUAL for details.
- Implemented kChanPrev (from a patch from Darren Salt).
- The "Update channels" parameter in the "Setup/DVB" menu has been extended to
  allow updating only the PIDs (see MANUAL for details). When updating to this
  version of VDR, please verify that the setting is as you want it to be, because
  the values have been shifted.
- The new APIVERSION (see config.h) now allows existing compiled plugins to be

- If a timer is newly created from within the "Schedule" menu, and its event is
  already running or has its start time within the next two minutes, it now goes
  directly into the "Edit timer" menu in order to allow the user to make further
  changes to timer parameters before the actual recording starts (inspired by
  Christian Wieninger's "epgsearch" plugin).
- Added format check to syslog_with_tid().
- Updated the INSTALL file's section about non-VDR files in the video directory
  (since version 1.3.38 disk access is done in a separate thread, so the watchdog
  timer won't hit).
- Changed the behaviour of the "Use small font" setup option to *always* use the small
  font if set to '2' - even if it would have been a fixed font (suggested by Ronny
  Kornexl).
- No longer using characters 0x01 and 0x02 for mapping single quote and slash in
  recording names (thanks to Patrick Fischer for reporting that this was a problem
  with XML). The single quote is not mapped at all, and the slash is interchanged
  with the tilde. Existing recordings will be handled like before, so there is
  no need to actually rename them.
- The cRemote::CallPlugin() function now has a boolean return value that tells
  the caller whether initiating the plugin call was successful (suggested by
  Reinhard Nissl). If it returns false, another plugin call is currently pending
  and the caller should try again later. This also means that the SVDRP command
  PLUG can now return an error code is the call fails.
- The new function cPlugin::MainThreadHook() can be used by plugins to perform
  actions in the context of the main program thread. Use this function with great
  care and only of you absolutely have to! See also PLUGINS.html.

2006-04-23: Version 1.3.48

- Updated the GPL copies (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed several spelling errors (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Updated the Polish OSD texts (thanks to Jaroslaw Swierczynski).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Updated the French OSD texts (thanks to Pierre Briec).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Updated the Romanian OSD texts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Updated the Slovenian OSD texts (thanks to Matjaz Thaler).
- Fixed wrong credits for the patch that was used to implement cPlugin::Active().
- Simplified the 'grep|awk|sed' command to retrieve the VDR/APIVERSION to a single
  'sed' call.
- Updated the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).
- Modified the German OSD texts to be "less technical" (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Extended the version number reported with the '-V' option to also show the
  current APIVERSION (suggested by Thomas Günther).
- Fixed handling empty titles in cEvent::FixEpgBugs() (reported by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed some missing '-' in the German OSD texts (thanks to Walter Koch).
- Added an error message about plugins that don't honor APIVERSION in their Makefile
  (based on a suggestion by Udo Richter).
- Fixed a format string in recording.c to avoid a compiler warning on 64bit systems
  (thanks to Christian Wieninger for reporting, and Werner Schweer for pointing out
  that the 'z' modifier should be used here).
- Ignoring k_Repeat when deciding whether the same key has been pressed in string
  input fields (based on a patch from Marko Mäkelä).

2006-04-28: Version 1.3.49

- Fixed initializing 'noapiv' in the Makefile (reported by Ronny Kornexl).
- Fixed extracting APIVERSION to work with older versions of 'sed' (reported by
  Oliver Endriss; thanks also to Udo Richter for a shorter version of the 'sed'
  expression).
- Fixed broken APIVERSION extraction line in 'newplugin' (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed entering '0' in a cMenuEditIntItem (reported by Mirko Dölle).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Nino Gerbino).
- Added a note about adding 'INCLUDES += -I$(DVBDIR)/include' to an existing
  Make.config (problem reported by Markus Ehrnsperger).
- Fixed handling the cPluginManager::Active() result when pressing the "Power" key
  (reported by Werner Färber).
- Added a hint about commenting out the line '#define USE_FADVISE' in tools.c in
  case of problems with replaying in fast forward mode if the video directory is
  mounted via a Samba share (reported by Andy Grobb).
- Changed the "Really restart?" prompt in the call to cPluginManager::Active() in
  menu.c to "restart anyway?" (suggested by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Removed the obsolete "'1' for encrypted radio channels" part from the description
  of the VPID in vdr.5 (reported by Alexander Hans).
- Fixed tuning to the channel of a VPS timer if the device is the actual device.

2006-04-30: Version 1.4.0

- Fixed handling the "Power" key in case a recording is going on and no plugin
  is active (thanks to Udo Richter; bug reported by Dominique Simon).
- Updated the Polish OSD texts (thanks to Jaroslaw Swierczynski).
- Fixed a memory leak in handling external EPG data (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- Fixed a memory leak in closing the video file during replay (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Nino Gerbino and Antonio Ospite).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).

2006-05-14: Version 1.4.0-1

- Updated 'S110W' in 'sources.conf'.
- Adjusted the 'runvdr' script so that the user can fill in the functions to
  detect, load and unload the necessary driver modules (thanks to M. Kiesel for
  reporting that it still used DVBDIR).
- Added 'eval' to the $VDRCMD call in 'runvdr' to avoid problems with quoting
  (suggested by Udo Richter).
- Fixed missing ',' in the Italian and Polish OSD texts (thanks to Marko Mäkelä).
- Updated the Czech OSD texts (thanks to Vladimír Bárta).
- Fixed handling the "Power" key in case a timer is about to start recording
  (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Fixed the character 'r' in fontosd and fontsml for iso8859-2 (thanks to Vladimír
  Bárta).
- When checking whether a VPS timer has entered the "VPS margin", the event's start
  time is now used instead of the timer's start time, because otherwise events that
  start way off of their VPS time wouldn't be recorded correctly.
- If VPS timers are active, their events are now being kept up to date if there
  are any free devices available.
- Fixed the character #207 in fontosd for iso8859-2 (thanks to Vladimír Bárta).
- Fixed handling unknown codes when learning LIRC remote control codes (reported
  by Helmut Auer).
- Since some channels (especially the Austrian ORF) randomly change the ids of their
  EPG events, VDR now gives the start time precedence when searching for existing
  events.
- Fixed automatically updating the CAM menu in case the whole operation (for
  instance a firmware update) takes longer than the menu timeout.

2006-05-28: Version 1.4.0-2

- Removed leftover LSMOD=... line from 'runvdr'.
- Modified the Makefile to copy additional libraries a plugin might provide (suggested
  by Wayne Keer). See PLUGINS.html for details.
- Fixed handling Transfer Mode when replaying Dolby Digital audio and the option
  '-a' was given (based on a patch from Werner Fink). To avoid having to increment
  the API version, several #if checks have been introduced around this. These will
  be removed once the API version actually needs to be incremented.
- Fixed deleting the 'skinDescriptions' in cMenuSetupOSD::~cMenuSetupOSD() (thanks
  to Tobias Grimm).
- Fixed calculating the start time of repeated timers with "first day" (thanks to
  Udo Richter).
- Now setting a timer's cached start time to 0 after a call to Skip() (thanks to
  Udo Richter).
- Fixed handling the running status of EPG events in case the "Schedule" menu is
  currently open (i.e. a write lock on the schedules data can't be achieved).
- Fixed handling VPS timers in case the EPG event hasn't been 'seen' in a while.
- Fixed calculating the cache size in cUnbufferedFile::Read() (thanks to Artur Skawina).
- Removed -fPIC from VDR's and libsi's Makefile (suggested by Prakash Punnoor).
- Modified the device selection to better handle timer conflicts (reported by
  Christian Wieninger).
- Avoiding a compiler warning in libsi's TypeLoop::operator[].
- Now processing the "frequency list descriptor" (based on a patch from Anssi Hannula).
- Improved the repeat function for LIRC remote controls (thanks to Joerg Riechardt).
- Fixed moving channels, which sometimes stopped the current replay session
  (reported by Mirko Dölle).
- Fixed deleting channels in case the current channel's number changes (reported
  by Mirko Dölle).

2006-06-04: Version 1.4.0-3

- Fixed the PremiereContentTransmissionDescriptor in 'libsi' (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Removed all the compatibility '#if APIVERSNUM...' stuff and instead increased
  the API version number - plugins will have to be recompiled.
- Removed the call to pthread_setschedparam(childTid, SCHED_RR, 0) in thread.c,
  because it caused a compiler warning with post-2.4 glibc (reported by Ville Skyttä).
  Since the third parameter has to be non-null to have any effect, the call was
  presumably a NOP, anyway.
- Fixed the 'clean-plugins' target in the Makefile to also remove additional
  plugin libraries (thanks to Wayne Keer).
- Applied the fixes to moving and deleting channels from version 1.4.0-2 to the
  SVDRP commands MOVC and DELC as well.
- Fixed handling the display of the '*' indicator in the "What's on now/next?"
  menu, so that events that haven't been "seen" in the data stream within 30
  seconds won't be shown as "running".
- Fixed handling tabbed item display in 'skincurses'.
- Increased the column spacing in the "Recordings" menu (was too small for the
  'skincurses' plugin).
- When the 'skincurses' plugin is loaded, it automatically sets the 'curses'
  skin as the current one. This doesn't modify the Setup.OSDSkin parameter, so
  that after using 'skincurses' (for instance for debugging) the previously
  selected skin will be used again.
- Added some log messages when setting the current skin.
- Only making a second attempt to set the current skin at startup if the first
  attempt has failed.
- Now switching to non-VPS timers' channels 60 seconds before the timer starts
  (if a free device is available), to allow for the updating of EPG data and CA
  descriptors before the actual recording starts.

2006-06-11: Version 1.4.1

- Changed the log messages when grabbing an image from 'isyslog()' to 'dsyslog()'
  so that they can be suppressed in normal operation mode to avoid clogging the
  log file in case this function is used frequently (suggested by Helmut Auer).

2006-06-18: Version 1.4.1-1

- Added "-fPIC" to the compiler options in Make.config.template when compiling
  plugins (thanks to Udo Richter). If you use your own Make.config file, you may
  want to add these lines there, too.
- Added some comment to cDevice::GetDevice() to explain how the individual
  conditions are put together to make a decision on which device to use.
- Updated 'S13E' in 'sources.conf' (thanks to Antti Hartikainen).
- Now making sure VPS timers don't get stuck with outdated events, and that the
  actual device isn't used for updating a VPS timer's event as long as other
  free devices are available.
- Modified rcu.c to better handle RC5 codes.
- Added a missing variable initialization in cRingBufferLinear::cRingBufferLinear()
  (thanks to Prakash Punnoor).
- Fixed handling relative link targets in the ReadLink() function (reported by
  Patrick Cernko).
- Now making sure a VPS timer has a schedule in case the epg.data file didn't
  contain one when VDR was started.

2006-07-23: Version 1.4.1-2

- Fixed the Makefile of the 'servicedemo' plugin, so that it defines the
  PLUGIN macro, which allows the Make.config file to react properly when
  compiling the plugin (reported by Bernd Melcher).
  Note to all plugin developers: a plugin's Makefile *must* define the PLUGIN
  macro, even if it doesn't use it itself!
- Added a comment regarding the PLUGIN macro to the 'newplugin' script.
- Added '--vfat' to the vdr.1 man page (reported by Udo Richter).
- Removed a double fdopen() in cPipe::Open() (reported by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed handling the running status of EPG events before the currently running one,
  in case they are added after the current event.
- cEIT::cEIT() now calls pSchedule->SetPresentSeen() even if OnlyRunningStatus is
  true.
- Newlines in title and short text of an EPG event are now changed into blanks only
  after all other fixes, because a short text might become a description.
- Fixed handling network masks in the svdrphosts.conf file (thanks to Patrick
  Maier).
- Fixed handling relative volume settings in the call to cStatus::MsgSetVolume()
  (reported by Norbert Wentz).
- Added a missing initialization of 'mutex' in cCiMenu::cCiMenu() and removed
  some superfluous semicolons in ci.c (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed handling client side termination of SVDRP connections (thanks to Frank
  Schmirler).
- cDevice::GetDevice() now prefers any device that's already receiving and doesn't
  require detaching receivers (suggested by Anssi Hannula).
- Fixed handling numeric keys in the channel display after switching channel groups
  (thanks to Andreas Regel).
- Menu items derived from cMenuEditIntItem now loop though their values if they
  have a dedicated minimum or maximum limit (suggested by Andy Grobb). Looping is
  only done for normal keypresses, not for repeated ones. This allows the user to
  scroll the value all the way to the limit by keeping the key pressed.

2006-08-06: Version 1.4.1-3

- Fixed assigning schedules to channels in case there is no initial EPG information
  (thanks to Frank Schmirler).
- Increased the APIVERSION to allow plugins that relied on the cStatus::MsgSetVolume()
  bug to react properly (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed cDevice::ToggleMute() (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- Fixed deleting the last character of a string menu item in insert mode (thanks
  to Udo Richter).
- The /video/.update file is now touched _after_ an editing process is finished
  in order to avoid excessive disk access (thanks to Artur Skawina).
- Fixed handling the running status of EPG events before the currently running one,
  in case they are added after the current event (cont'd from version 1.4.1-2).
- Modified the shutdown mechanism, so that the shutdown script is never given a
  time in the past (reported by Helmut Auer). If a timer is currently recording,
  or a recording would start within the next 30 minutes (default for the "Min.
  event timeout" setup parameter), and the user insists in shutting down now, the
  reboot time given to the shutdown script will correspond to a time that is
  "Min. event timeout" minutes (default is 30) in the future.
- Avoiding shutdown message "Recording in ... minutes, shut down anyway?" with
  a negative number of minutes (reported by Udo Richter).
- Fixed getting the next active timer when shutting down (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Modified the cSVDRP::Close() function to avoid code duplication.

2006-08-13: Version 1.4.1-4

- Fixed converting the port number in the "connect from..." log message of SVDRP
  (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Made the cCiSession members sessionId and resourceId uint16_t and uint32_t,
  respectively, to match their types in the CI session data (thanks to Ville Skyttä
  for reporting that there are places where ntohs() is assigned to different types).
- Changed the way a device is selected for receiving in order to keep devices with
  CAMs better available, even if this means recording on the primary device (reported
  by Jörn Reder; thanks to Anssi Hannula for improving handling Transfer Mode devices
  in this).
- No longer stopping removing empty directories if an error occurs (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss).
- Added a log error message to cPlugin::ConfigDirectory() in case a plugin calls it
  from a separate thread (reported by Udo Richter).

2006-08-20: Version 1.4.1-5

- Replaced the "quick workaround for additional live audio PIDs" in
  cDvbDevice::SetChannelDevice() with an actual solution in
  cDvbDevice::SetAudioTrackDevice() in order to prevent sticky PIDs in CAMs,
  which caused long switching times or completely blank screens when switching
  between encrypted channels on the same transponder (reported by Tomas Berglund).
- Adapted cThread::ThreadId() to recent kernels (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Added --remove-destination to the 'cp' command for binaries in the Makefile to
  avoid a crash in case a new version is installed on a running system (suggested
  by Petri Hintukainen).
- Fixed handling "Ca Info" in case the CAM sends this again if the smart card is
  replaced with a different one.

2006-08-27: Version 1.4.2

- Revoked the change to cDevice::GetDevice() that was introduced in version 1.4.1-2,
  which made it prefer any device that's already receiving and doesn't require
  detaching receivers. This change has caused some unwanted behavior, so further
  testing is necessary.

2006-09-03: Version 1.4.2-1

- Added LC_ALL to the checks for UTF-8 at startup (suggested by Matthias Schwarzott).
- Fixed the cTimer::operator=() so that it won't mess up the cListObject's pointers
  (reported by Alexander Rieger).
- Fixed a memory leak in the cTimer::operator=() when using the 'aux' string
  (reported by Alexander Rieger).
- Fixed processing the PDCDescriptor in 'libsi' on big endian systems (thanks to
  Martin Ostermann).
- Fixed handling relative volume settings that unmute the audio in the call to
  cStatus::MsgSetVolume() (reported by Oliver Endriss).

2006-09-09: Version 1.4.2-2

- Fixed cTimer::operator=() in case a cTimer variable is assigned to itself (thanks
  to Alexander Rieger).
- Implemented a copy constructor for cTimer (thanks to Udo Richter for reporting that
  an assignment in svdrp.c didn't use the cTimer::operator=()).

2006-09-17: Version 1.4.2-3

- Added --remove-destination to the 'cp' command for binaries in the Makefiles of
  the plugins (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The 'skincurses' plugin now adjusts the size of the OSD to the size of the console
  window.
- Fixed deleting expired VPS timers (under certain conditions a timer could have been
  deleted before it even started recording).
- Updated the Hungarian language texts (thanks to Istvan Koenigsberger and Guido Josten).
- Fixed handling video directory updates in case the timestamp of the .update file
  is in the future (thanks to Petri Hintukainen).

2006-09-23: Version 1.4.3

- Official release.

2006-10-08: Version 1.4.3-1

- The function cThread::Cancel() now only sets 'running' to false and does not
  actually kill the thread if the special value -1 is given (suggested by Udo Richter).
- Changed the I18nNormalizeLanguageCode() check to also allow blanks (and all other
  printable characters) in the language codes (thanks to Boguslaw Juza for reporting
  that there are stations that use blanks in these codes). Blanks are replaced with
  underlines, so that all parts of VDR that rely on language codes to be one word
  (without blanks) work as expected.
- Now clearing an event's Title, ShortText and Description if there is no
  ShortEventDescriptor or ExtendedEventDescriptor, respectively (thanks to Boguslaw
  Juza for reporting that events without an ExtendedEventDescriptor may get
  duplicate information in their ShortText through the EPG bugfixes in case they
  are received again).
- Fixed handling video directory updates in case an other process has touched the
  .update file after the last NeedsUpdate() check (thanks to Petri Hintukainen).
- Fixed handling language codes and descriptions of recorded audio tracks on channels
  with multiple tracks where not all of them appear in the event data (reported by
  Boguslaw Juza).

2006-10-15: Version 1.4.3-2

- Fixed clearing an event's Title, ShortText and Description in case the data comes
  from an external source.
- Updated the Hungarian language texts (thanks to Guido Josten).
- Fixed a possible crash if cPluginManager::GetPlugin() is called with a NULL
  pointer (thanks to Petri Hintukainen).
- Fixed displaying the error log message in case an unknown plugin was requested
  in a key macro (thanks to Petri Hintukainen).
- Keys from expanded key macros are now put into the front of the key queue to
  avoid problems if the queue is not empty at that time (based on a patch from
  Petri Hintukainen).
- cKeyMacro now has an explicit counter for the number of keys it contains.
- cRemote::PutMacro() now sets a lock while it expands the macro (thanks to
  Petri Hintukainen).
- Fixed handling plugins from cRemote::PutMacro() and cRemote::CallPlugin()
  (based on a patch from Petri Hintukainen).
- Increased the size of the key queue to avoid problems with long key macros.

2006-10-22: Version 1.4.3-3

- Fixed setting audio track descriptions after a replay has been stopped (reported
  by Ulf Kiener, thanks to Marco Schlüßler for pointing out what caused the problem).

2006-10-29: Version 1.4.3-4

- Fixed deleting EPG events that have a running status of "pausing" or higher.
- Fixed handling NITs with more than one delivery system descriptor tag for the
  same transponder.

2006-11-04: Version 1.4.4

- Fixed displaying the replay mode symbol in case of "Multi speed mode" (reported
  by Marco Schlüßler).

2006-12-03: Version 1.4.4-1

- Some improvements to the man pages (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed a possible segfault in cSkins::Message() (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Made the getskyepg.pl script of the 'sky' plugin send a user agent message to
  the server, according to the rules at http://bleb.org/tv/data/listings.
  If your version of 'wget' doesn't support the -U option to set the user agent,
  use the new option -U of getskyepg.pl to have the information added to the URL
  as a query string.
- The getskyepg.pl script now replaces "&amp;" with "&".
- Fixed a possible crash in remux.c on 64-bit machines (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed a typo in the change to the "Use small font" setup option in version 1.3.47
  in the HISTORY and CONTRIBUTORS file (reported by Andreas Brugger).
- Added a missing 'const' to cRecordingInfo::ChannelID() (reported by Andreas
  Brugger). This required the APIVERSION to be increased, so plugins will have to
  be recompiled.
- Now calling cPluginManager::Active() only if VDR is really trying to shut down,
  and waiting for 5 minutes before calling it again (thanks to Jörg Wendel for
  reporting that cPlugin::Active() was called too often, and to Udo Richter for
  some hints on how to improve this).
- Replaced 'unsigned long' with 'uint32_t' and 'uint64' with 'uint64_t' to
  avoid problems on 64-bit machines.

2006-12-03: Version 1.4.4-2

- Added '#include <stdint.h>' to font.h (reported by Peter Pinnau).
- Added a compatibility define for 'uint64' to tools.h, so that existing
  plugins don't need to be modified immediately (reported by Suur Karu).
  This will be removed in version 1.5.

2007-01-05: Version 1.4.4-3

- Fixed a possible segfault if VDR gets terminated while a message is displayed
  (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Fixed the INSTALL section on retrying shutdown later (reported by Udo Richter).
- When entering text via the numeric keys, the characters are now checked against
  the allowed characters (thanks to Frank Schmirler).
- Added a missing break statement in cCiHandler::OpenSession().

2007-01-07: Version 1.4.5

- Official release.

2007-01-07: Version 1.5.0

- The CAM handling has been refactored. Instead of a cCiHandler per device there
  is now an abstract cCiAdapter and a cCamSlot. This allows each slot to be
  accessed individually.
- The general 15 seconds workaround time before opening the CAM menu has been
  removed. If the CAM menu doesn't open within a timeout, the enter menu command
  is now sent again.
- If a CAM is reset or pulled and reinserted, it now automatically starts
  decrypting the current channel again.
- The Setup/CAM menu now dynamically refreshes its items and displays whether
  a CAM is present or ready. The 'Reset' function no longer leaves the menu.
- The CAM menu will now be opened when pressing the Ok key on a slot entry.
- The CAM menu now stays within the current menu context and doesn't close and
  reopen the menu every time an option is selected.
- When an encrypted channel is switched to for the first time, VDR now checks
  explicitly whether a CAM can actually decrypt that channel. If there is more
  than one CAM in the system that claims to be able to decrypt the channel,
  they are all tried in turn.
  To make this possible, an encrypted channel needs to be received in Transfer
  Mode when it is switched to for the first time, so that VDR can determine
  whether the TS packets are actually decrypted. Once a channel is known to
  be decrypted by a particular CAM, the next time it is switched to it will
  be shown in normal live viewing mode.
- A cDevice now automatically detaches all cReceiver objects that receive PIDs
  that can't be decrypted with the current CAM. A plugin that attaches a cReceiver
  to a device should therefore watch the receiver's IsAttached() function to
  see if it is still attached to the device.
- The cReceiver constructor no longer takes an 'int Ca' as its first parameter,
  but rather a 'tChannelID ChannelID'. This is necessary for the device to be
  able to determine which CAM a particular channel can be decrypted with. If the
  channel is known to be unencrypted, or a plugin doesn't want to provide the
  channel id for other reasons, an invalid tChannelID() can be given.
- The cThread::Start() function now waits until a previous incarnation of this
  thread has actually stopped. Before this it could happen that a thread's
  Cancel(-1) function was called and immediately after that it was started again,
  but the Start() function still found it to be 'active'.
- The parameter NeedsDetachReceivers in cDevice::GetDevice(const cChannel *Channel, ...)
  has been removed. A call to this function will automatically detach all receivers
  from the device if it returns a non-NULL pointer.
- The cTimeMs class now accepts an initial timeout value in its constructor.
- A CAM is now explicitly instructed to stop decrypting when switching away from
  an encrypted channel.
- If the CAM in use can decrypt several channels at the same time, VDR can
  now make use if this capability. Whether or not a CAM can decrypt more
  than one channel is determined by sending it an initial empty QUERY command
  and testing whether it replies to it.
- Ca values in the range 0...F in channels.conf can still be used to assign a channel
  to a particular device, but this will no longer work with encrypted channels because
  without valid CA ids VDR can't decide which CAM slot to use. However, since VDR now
  automatically determines which CAM can decrypt which channel, setting fixed
  channel/device relations should no longer be necessary.
  IF AN ENCRYPTED CHANNEL CAN'T BE DECRYPTED AND YOU HAVE A CA VALUE IN THE RANGE
  0...F FOR THAT CHANNEL, SET IT TO 0 (FTA) AND TUNE TO THE CHANNEL AGAIN.

2007-01-28: Version 1.4.5-1

- Fixed i18n characters for the Hungarian texts (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Now using cPipe instead of popen() in cCommand::Execute() to avoid problems
  with open file handles when starting background commands (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).

2007-02-24: Version 1.4.5-2

- Removed 'assert(0)' from cDvbSpuDecoder::setTime() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed a possible crash when loading an invalid XPM file (thanks to Martin Wache).
- Updated satellite names in 'sources.conf' (thanks to Thilo Wunderlich).
- Fixed handling error status in cDvbTuner::GetFrontendStatus() (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).

2007-03-03: Version 1.4.6

- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).

2007-02-25: Version 1.5.1

- Added cDevice::HasCi() so that devices with Common Interface can be avoided
  when tuning to an FTA channel, thus preserving the CAM resources even on budget
  DVB cards (suggested by Petri Helin).
- Fixed i18n characters for the Hungarian texts (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Now using cPipe instead of popen() in cCommand::Execute() to avoid problems
  with open file handles when starting background commands (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Removed 'assert(0)' from cDvbSpuDecoder::setTime() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed a possible crash when loading an invalid XPM file (thanks to Martin Wache).
- Updated satellite names in 'sources.conf' (thanks to Thilo Wunderlich).
- Adapted 'libsi' to DVB-S2 (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed handling error status in cDvbTuner::GetFrontendStatus() (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Shutdown handling has been rewritten (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Plugins can now implement the new function WakeupTime() to request VDR to wake
  up at a particular time (thanks to Udo Richter).
- The HUP signal now forces a restart of VDR (thanks to Udo Richter).
- cThread::EmergencyExit() has been replaced by ShutdownHandler.RequestEmergencyExit().
- Several references to "button" in a remote control context have been changed
  to "key" (based on a report from Marko Mäkelä regarding the "Menu button closes"
  text). The "MenuButtonCloses" parameter in 'setup.conf' has therefore been
  renamed to "MenuKeyCloses", accordingly. This will result in an "unknown config
  parameter: MenuButtonCloses" error message in the log file, so you may want to
  remove that entry from your 'setup.conf' file.
- Simplified the error handling in cDvbTuner::GetFrontendStatus() (based on a
  discussion with Reinhard Nissl).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Increased the maximum number of DVB devices to 8 (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The new Setup parameter "Channel entry timeout" can be used to customize the time
  since the last keypress until a numerically entered channel number is considered
  complete, and the channel is switched (suggested by Helmut Auer). Setting this
  parameter to 0 turns off the automatic channel switching, and the user will
  have to confirm the entry by pressing the "Ok" key.

2007-04-22: Version 1.5.2

- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling user activity for shutdown, which I had messed when adopting Udo's
  original patch (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Added Turkish language texts (thanks to Oktay Yolgeçen).
- Added missing rules for generating iso8859-13 font to Makefile.
- 'libsi' now converts the incoming strings into the system's character set
  according to the DVB standard. The system's character set is determined from
  the LANG environment variable. If no recognizable setting can be found, no
  conversion will take place. Note that currently only the strings received from the
  SI data stream are converted, there have not been any changes regarding displaying
  UTF-8 characters on the OSD, yet - this will follow in one of the next steps.
  With this conversion, it should now be safe to run VDR on a UTF-8 file system,
  because all incoming characters are converted to UTF-8. This will most likely
  result in wrong characters being displayed on the OSD (because there UTF-8 is
  not known, yet), but the file names should be ok (haven't tested this myself,
  though, because I don't do UTF-8 - so please be very careful when testing!).
  There's one piece of bad news here: the German pay-tv broadcaster Premiere
  apparently encodes all EPG strings as ISO8859-1, but fails to correctly mark
  these strings as such. Therefore 'libsi' (following the DVB standard) considers
  the strings to be encoded in the default ISO6937 and converts them to whatever
  the system's character set is. This, of course, results in wrong umlauts.
  On its old transponder, the ProSieben/SAT.1 channels also had their EPG data
  wrongly encoded, but apparently on the new transponder they started broadcasting
  on this month, they got it right.

2007-04-30: Version 1.4.6-1

- Fixed a busy loop in fast forward if the next video data file is missing
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed handling frequencies in NitFilter::Process() (thanks to Anssi Hannula).
- Fixed handling ChannelUp/Down keys if there is currently a replay running
  (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Increased the maximum number of CA system ids to cope with the AlphaCrypt
  CAM's version 3.11 firmware.

2007-05-12: Version 1.4.7

- Official release.

2007-06-10: Version 1.5.3

- Fixed some spelling errors in 'newplugin' (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed a busy loop in fast forward if the next video data file is missing
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed handling frequencies in NitFilter::Process() (thanks to Anssi Hannula).
- Fixed a race condition with signal handlers at program exit (thanks to Udo
  Richter).
- Non-primary devices in Transfer mode are now also used for recording (thanks
  to Anssi Hannula).
- Fixed handling ChannelUp/Down keys if there is currently a replay running
  (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- The new SVDRP command REMO can be used to turn VDR's remote control off and
  on in case other programs need to be controlled (based on patches from Krzysztof
  Parma and Helmut Auer).
- Increased the maximum number of CA system ids to cope with the AlphaCrypt
  CAM's version 3.11 firmware.
- Fixed getting the code setting from the locale (thanks to Matthias Schwarzott).
- Implemented support for Freetype fonts (based on a patch from Alexander Riedel).
  The font names and sizes can be adjusted in the "Setup/OSD" menu.
  Note that VDR now requires freetype fonts to be installed in
  /usr/share/fonts/truetype.
- If the OSD device in use has at least 8bpp bitmap depth and this is also
  used by the current skin, Freetype fonts are displayed "anti-aliased".
  The new setup parameter "OSD/Anti-alias" can be used to turn this off.
- The new function cOsd::SetAntiAliasGranularity() can be used to help the OSD
  in managing the available color palette entries when doing anti-aliasing.
  Skins that use 8bpp bitmaps can call this function with the maximum number
  of colors used, and the maximum number of color combinations. The OSD will
  then evenly split the available palette entries between the various colors
  combinations, so that fonts can be "anti-aliased". By default a total of
  10 colors and 10 combinations is assumed.
- The pixel fonts have been completely removed from the VDR source.
- VDR is now "UTF-8 aware". It handles strings according to the character
  encoding used on the user's system. All internationalization strings and
  incoming SI data are converted to the system encoding.
- Plugins that handle strings need to be aware that on systems with UTF-8
  encoding a "character symbol" may consist of more than a single byte in
  memory. The functions and macros named Utf8...() can be used to handle
  strings without needing to care about the underlying character encoding
  (see tools.h for details).
- Even though the weekdays of repeating timers are presented to the user as UTF-8
  characters in the OSD, the timers.conf file and the SVDRP timer commands still
  use single byte characters ("MTWTFSS") to make sure this information is handled
  correctly between systems with different character encodings.
- Added a missing i18n string for "CAM" in the Turkish OSD texts.
- Improved editing strings that are too long to fit into the editable area.
- Changes to the OSD settings in the "Setup/OSD" menu now immediately take effect
  when the "Ok" key is pressed.

2007-06-17: Version 1.5.4

- Increased APIVERSION (forgot to do that in 1.5.2 and 1.5.3).
- Fixed a crash in i18n character set conversion (thanks to Alexander Riedel,
  Jose Alberto Reguero and Christian Wieninger for patches that cured part of
  the problem).
- Adjusted the 'skincurses' plugin to UTF-8 handling.
- Using nl_langinfo(CODESET) to determine the local codeset to use (thanks to
  Thomas Günther). The codeset names in 'libsi/si.c' have been changed to the
  canonical spelling with '-' (thanks to Ludwig Nussel for pointing this out).
- Modified handling invalid characters in VFAT mode.
- Replaced strn0cpy() with Utf8Strn0Cpy() where necessary.
- Now using 'fontconfig' to determine which fonts to use (thanks to Anssi Hannula
  for code and hints on how to do this).
- If no fonts are installed, VDR now uses a dummy font that doesn't actually draw
  any text, and logs an error message.
- The new function cFont::CreateFont() can be used by plugins to create and use
  fonts of their own, independent of VDR's standard fonts.
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Changed the parameter "OSD font" to "Default font" in "Setup/OSD" (suggested
  by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling detached processes in SystemExec() (thanks to Udo Richter).
- The info.vdr file now also stores the name of the channel, and the new function
  cRecordingInfo::ChannelName() returns this information if available (based on
  a patch from Alexander Hans).
- The new function cOsd::SetOsdPosition() can be used to dynamically change the
  position and size of the OSD (based on a request from Christoph Haubrich).
  Plugins that implement skins should no longer use Setup.OSDWidth etc. directly,
  but should rather use cOsd::OsdWidth() etc. instead.
  Currently a change to the OSD position will only apply to newly opened OSDs.

2007-06-23: Version 1.5.5

- Fixed a name clash between skincurses.c and the new cOsd position functions.
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Changed the parameter "OSD font size" to "Default font size" in "Setup/OSD".
- Fixed handling address masks in SVDRP host settings (thanks to Frank Schmirler).
- Fonts can now be created with a width that overwrites the default width (thanks
  to Andreas Mair).
- Added full weekday names to i18n.c for plugins to use (thanks to Patrice Staudt).
  The new function WeekDayNameFull() can be used to get these names from integer
  values (just like the abbreviated weekday names).
- Fixed stripping i18n stuff from font names (reported by Anssi Hannula).
- Improved performance of the SVDRP commands LSTC and CHAN when used with a
  channel name.

2007-07-22: Version 1.5.6

- Fixed a buffer overflow in initializing the system character table (thanks
  to Marco Schlüßler).
- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Fixed handling single byte characters >0x7F in Utf8ToArray() (thanks to Udo
  Richter).
- Improved numdigits(), isnumber() and strreplace() (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).
- Fixed clearing color buttons in the 'curses' skin (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Fixed a typo in the function name of cOsd::SetOsdPosition() and added a range
  check to it (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Improved cControl::Launch() to keep 'control' from pointing to uninitialized
  memory (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Made skipspace() an inline function (suggested by Tobias Bratfisch) and changed
  it to handle the most common case of 'no leading space' very fast, and avoid
  calling isspace(), which made the whole function a lot faster.
- Fixed detection of Premiere NVOD channel links (thanks to Markus Hahn).
- Added a table of the used trick speed values to the description of
  cDevice::TrickSpeed() (suggested by Martin Dauskardt).
- Added a missing 'P' to vdr.c's SHUTDOWNCANCELROMPT macro (reported by Marco
  Schlüßler).

2007-08-12: Version 1.5.7

- All logging now goes to LOG_ERR, because some systems split error, info and
  debug messages into separate files, which repeatedly caused extra efforts to
  find out when incomplete log excerpts were attached to problem reports in
  the past.
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Fixed a problem with characters >0x7F in the modified version of skipspace()
  (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed a bug I introduced when simplifying the original patch for detecting
  Premiere NVOD channel links (crash reported by Malte Schröder).
- Internationalization is now done with 'gettext' (following a suggestion by
  Lucian Muresan). Plugin authors may want to use the Perl script
  'i18n-to-gettext.pl' to convert their internationalized texts to the gettext
  format (see the instructions inside that script file). The function
  cPlugin::RegisterI18n() is still present for compatibility, but doesn't
  have any more functionality. So plugins that don't convert their texts to
  the gettext format will only present English texts.
  See PLUGINS.html, section "Internationalization", for instructions on how
  to make strings in arrays translatable.
  See README.i18n for information on how to create new or maintain existing
  translations.
- The three letter language codes and their aliases are stored in i18n.c, and
  each translation file only contains one of them to link that language name
  to the code.
- The 'newplugin' script has been extended to generate the Makefile section
  for i18n support.
- The parameter OSDLanguage in 'setup.conf' is now a string and holds the locale
  code of the selected OSD language (e.g. en_US). If Setup.OSDLanguage is not
  set to a particular locale that is found in VDR's locale directory, the
  locale as defined in the system environment is used by default.
- The list of tracks given in cStatus::SetAudioTrack() is now NULL terminated,
  so that plugins can actually use all the strings in the list, not just the
  one pointed to by Index (thanks to Alexander Rieger).
- Fixed handling kLeft in the calls to cStatus::MsgOsdTextItem() (thanks to
  Alexander Rieger).
- Added the "...or (at your option) any later version" phrase to the license
  information of all plugins, and also the 'newplugin' script (suggested by
  Ville Skyttä). Plugin authors may want to consider doing the same.
- Fixed the link to the GPL2 at http://www.gnu.org in vdr.c (thanks to Ville
  Skyttä).
- cBitmap::SetXpm() now checks whether the given Xpm pointer is not NULL, to
  avoid a crash with files that only contain "/* XPM */" (suggested by Andreas
  Mair).
- Added a debug error message to cReceiver::~cReceiver() in case it is still
  attached to a device (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).

2007-08-19: Version 1.5.8

- Added missing install-i18n to the install target in the Makefile (reported
  by Joachim Wilke).
- Fixed a faulty comment in Make.config.template (reported by Marco Schlüßler).
- Improved i18n-to-gettext.pl (thanks to Matthias Schwarzott).
- Moved the "all" target in plugin Makefiles before the "Implicit rules",
  so that a plain "make" will compile everything (suggested by Matthias
  Schwarzott). The "newplugin" script has been changed accordingly.
  Plugin authors may want to change their Makefiles, too.
- Added DESTDIR and PREFIX handling to the Makefile (thanks to Matthias
  Schwarzott).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added internationalization to the "skincurses" plugin (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Checking the string for NULL in I18nTranslate().
- Updated the French OSD texts (thanks to Bruno Roussel).
- Some optimizations in cDvbDevice::SetChannelDevice() (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).
- Optimized cMenuEditChrItem::Set() (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).
- Optimized cNitFilter::Process() (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).
- Reduced the number of time(NULL) calls in vdr.c's main loop to a single call
  (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).
- Changed cBitmap::DrawText() to always draw the background unless ColorBg
  is clrTransparent (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- The "Setup/OSD/Language" menu now only shows those languages that actually
  have a locale (suggested by Anssi Hannula).
- Now using setenv() instead of setlocale() to set the language for gettext()
  (suggested by Anssi Hannula; thanks also to Ludwig Nussel for a hint on using
  _nl_msg_cat_cntr).
- When scanning the locale directory, VDR now explicitly looks for a file named
  vdr.mo. Text files for plugins are now named "vdr-name.mo", when "name" is the
  name of the plugin. The "newplugin" script has been changed accordingly, and
  plugin authors should change their Makefiles, too.

2007-08-26: Version 1.5.9

- Fixed handling locale directories with a large number of entries (thanks to
  Anssi Hannula).
- Updated Turkish language texts (thanks to Oktay Yolgeçen).
- Fixed stripping the context in I18nTranslate() (reported by Christian
  Wieninger).
- Fixed detecting whether a particular locale is actually supported.
- Added a note about LANG having to be set to a valid locale in INSTALL
  (suggested by Matthias Fechner).
- Fixed some compiler warnings with gcc-4.2.0 (thanks to Matthias Schwarzott).
- Fixed setting the locale file name in i18n-to-gettext.pl (thanks to Matthias
  Schwarzott).
- Changed the default for LOCDIR in Makefile and Make.config.template to
  "./locale", so that internationalization works by default when running VDR
  from within its source directory (suggested by Anssi Hannula).
- Added the new i18n macro trVDR(), which can be used by plugins to mark
  texts they want to reuse from VDR's core translations (suggested by Matthias
  Becker).
- VDR now uses the default configuration directory as defined in the CONFDIR
  variable in the Makefile (thanks to Thomas Schmidt).
- The SVDRP command LSTC can now list the channels with group separators if the
  option ':groups' is given (thanks to Andreas Mair).
- Added a missing error report to cCuttingThread::Action() (thanks to Udo
  Richter).
- There can now be more than one OSD at the same time. At any given time,
  however, only one of them can be active (and thus visible). This is to
  allow displaying things like subtitles in an easy way. A cOsd therefore
  now has a "Level", and only the OSD with the smallest level will be
  displayed. The level 0 OSD is special, and there can only be one with
  this level. If there is more than one OSD with a particular level, only
  the one that was created first will be displayed.
  Plugins that provide an OSD need to adjust their cOsdProvider::CreateOsd()
  function to hand through the Level.
- Fixed checking for ttDolbyLast in cDevice::SetCurrentAudioTrack() (thanks
  to Marco Schlüßler).

2007-10-14: Version 1.5.10

- Implemented handling DVB subtitles (thanks to Marco Schlüßler, and also to
  Pekka Virtanen for writing the subtitle plugin, which helped in implementing
  subtitle handling in VDR).
- The new remote control key "Subtitles" can be used to bring up the list
  of available subtitles.
- The new setup option "DVB/Subtitle languages" can be used to define the
  preferred languages for subtitles.
- Fixed selecting the audio track when pressing Ok in the Audio menu (thanks
  to Marco Schlüßler).
- Implemented display of DVB subtitles in live viewing mode.
- Implemented subtitle track selection.
- Implemented bitmap color reduction and shrinking to display subtitles even
  on devices that can't display the necessary number of colors.
- Added compatibility mode for playback of recordings made with the subtitles
  plugin (with some help from Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The new setup option "DVB/Subtitle offset" can be used to shift the location
  of the subtitles in the vertical direction.
- The new setup options "DVB/Subtitle foreground/background transparency"
  define an additional level of transparency for the foreground and background
  color of subtitles.
- Existing recordings made with the subtitle plugin can be given an 'X' record
  in their info.vdr file, so that subtitles can be automatically selected upon
  replay, according to the preferred language setup, as in
  X 3 03 ger deutsch
  (see vdr.5). Note that these entries need to be added in the proper sequence,
  so that they correspond with the actual track languages in the recording.
- Now generating translation files without line numbers to avoid unnecessarily
  large diffs. Plugin authors may want to replace the -F option with
  --no-location in the xgettext and msgmerge calls in their Makefiles.
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added a missing Channels.SetModified(true) call when deleting or moving a
  channel in the Channels menu (reported by Halim Sahin).
- Fixed a missing '-' at the next to last line of SVDRP help texts (reported by
  Denis Knauf).
- Added a missing SetVolumeDevice() call in cDevice::SetPrimaryDevice() (reported
  by Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed a crash when pressing Left while at the first character of a cMenuEditStrItem
  (thanks to Christian Wieninger).
- Only creating a new cDvbOsdProvider in cDvbDevice::MakePrimaryDevice() if 'On'
  is true (i.e. this device is being made the primary device).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Fixed handling reallocated memory in cCharSetConv::Convert() (reported by Udo
  Richter).
- Fixed a new[]/delete mismatch in cMenuEditStrItem::LeaveEditMode() (thanks to
  Udo Richter).
- Implemented sending all frames to devices that can handle them in fast forward
  trick speeds (thanks to Timo Eskola).
- Updated the Hungarian language texts (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Fixed description of DeviceSetAvailableTrack() and cReceiver(), and added an
  example ~cMyReceiver() in PLUGINS.html (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Improved the description of where logging goes in the INSTALL file (thanks to
  Elias Luttinen).
- Added a note about how to initiate internationalization support to the
  README.i18n file. The Makefile generated by the 'newplugin' script now has the
  'i18n' target automatically create an initial 'po/pluginname.pot' file.
  Plugin authors may want to add the '$(I18Npot)' dependency to the 'i18n'
  target in their Makefiles, as in
  i18n: $(I18Npot) $(I18Nmo)
  (based on a suggestion by Torsten Kunkel).
- Removed a duplicate ',' from the ca_ES.po file (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Added the 'ß' character to the "allowed characters" in the de_DE.po file
  (suggested by Thomas Günther).
- Made the default copy ctor of cRecording private (thanks to Markus Hahn).
  Same for the assign operator.
- Added cRecording::Undelete() (based on a patch from Markus Hahn).
- Added cDevice::CloseFilter() to allow a device to have complete control over
  both opening and closing section filters (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Some fixes to PLUGINS.html (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).

2007-11-04: Version 1.5.11

- Fixed checking compatibility mode for old subtitles plugin (thanks to Marco
  Schlüßler).
- Updated the French OSD texts (thanks to Michael Nival).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- The "Play" key now starts replay of the selected recording in the Recordings
  menu (thanks to Ville Skyttä);
- Improved shutdown handling (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Housekeeping now waits for a while after a replay has ended (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Added more special characters to the list of allowed characters when entering
  strings (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Added Ukrainian language texts (thanks to Yarema Aka Knedlyk).
- Added a workaround for recovering from wrongfully interpreted "pre 1.3.19 PS1 packets".
- Fixed a possible blocking in replay when subtitles are active.
- Fixed displaying subtitles in live mode.
- Fixed handling CONFDIR (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added some missing 'const' keywords (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt).
- The 'Allowed' parameter in cMenuEditStrItem() is now NULL by default, which results
  in using tr(FileNameChars) (suggested by Thomas Günther).
- Added a missing '.' to the date returned by DayDateTime() (thanks to Lauri Nurmi).
- Improved the 'i18n' target in the Makefile to avoid unnecessary work (thanks to
  Stefan Huelswitt). The 'newplugin' and 'i18n-to-gettext.pl' scripts have been
  changed accordingly. Plugin authors may want to adjust the 'i18n' target
  of their Makefiles.
- Fixed a crash if no fonts are found (thanks to Mario Ivankovits and Clemens
  Kirchgatterer).
- Fixed decoding filename characters in case there are not two hex digits after
  the '#' (reported by Helmut Auer).

2007-11-18: Version 1.5.12

- Fixed assembling PS1 packets in cTS2PES::instant_repack() (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Fixed handling small PES packets that caused subtitles to be displayed late
  in live mode (based on a patch from Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed stopping live subtitles when a player is attached to the device.
- Fixed suddenly stopping subtitles in live mode.

2008-01-13: Version 1.5.13

- Fixed the declaration of cSubtitleObject::Decode8BppCodeString() (thanks to
  Gregoire Favre).
- The new setup option "Miscellaneous/Emergency exit" can be used to turn off
  the automatic restart of VDR in case a recording fails for some reason.
- The kInfo key is now propagated to any open menu, so that it can react to it
  in a context sensitive manner (suggested by Andreas Brugger). If there is
  no menu open it will show the info of the current broadcast or replay.
- cTimeMs now uses the monotonic clock, if available (thanks to Petri Hintukainen).
- Fixed cVector::Clear() and cStringList::Clear().
- Added cString::Truncate().
- Fixed the "i18n:" target in the "newplugin" script, so that it can create the
  initial *.pot file.
- Fixed handling the '-l' option.
- Fixed error handling in cCuttingThread::Action() (thanks to Udo Richter).
- Fixed a loss of the date display in the "classic" skin's main menu (reported by
  Andreas Brugger).
- Added a missing setting of lastFreeMB in cMenuMain::Update() (reported by
  Andreas Brugger).
- Added '-Wno-parentheses' to the compiler options in order to avoid silly compiler
  warnings for expressions like 'a || b && c', where GCC 4.3 wants to force the
  programmer to write 'a || (b && c)', while everybody knows that '&&' links
  stronger than '||' (reported by Tobias Grimm).
- Updated the Hungarian language texts (thanks to István Füley).
- Fixed displaying weekday names in the Schedule menu if the system uses UTF-8
  (reported by Jiri Dobry).
- The new plugin "pictures" implements a simple picture viewer.
  See PLUGINS/src/pictures/README for details.
- The automatic shutdown is now suppressed if the remote control is currently
  disabled (suggested by Helmut Auer, implemented by Udo Richter).
- Added a section about "Logging" to PLUGINS.html (suggested by Torsten Kunkel).
- Enhanced the SVDRP command CLRE to allow clearing the EPG data of a particular
  channel (thanks to Benjamin Hess).

2008-01-27: Version 1.5.14

- Fixed the Play function in the pictures plugin.
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Updated the Makefile of the skincurses plugin (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The new option --localedir can be used to set the locale directory at runtime
  (based on a patch from Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed finding new transponders (thanks to Winfried Köhler).
- Implemented handling of DVB-S2 (thanks to Marco Schlüßler and Reinhard Nissl
  for a patch that was used to implement this). VDR now requires the "multiproto"
  DVB driver, e.g. from http://jusst.de/hg/multiproto.
- Removed switching to the next higher or lower channel if the current channel
  is not available, in order to allow staying on an encrypted channel that takes
  a while for the CAM to start decrypting.

2008-02-17: Version 1.5.15

- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Added option -i to the pictures plugin's pic2mpg to ignore unknown file types.
- Revoked the switch to the "multiproto" driver in order to make a new stable
  version before making this big switch and forcing all users to install a
  driver that is not yet in the kernel source. The removed code will reappear
  in version 1.7.0.
  Note that you may need to switch back to an older version of your channels.conf
  file if you have already used version 1.5.14, because it introduced new parameters.
- Added the new command line option --userdump to enable core dumps in case VDR
  is run as root with option -u (thanks to Hans-Werner Hilse).
- Speeded up anti-aliased font rendering by caching the blend indexes (based on
  a suggestion by Martin Wache).
- Fixed setting the OSD area in the pictures plugin.
- Ignoring "repeat" and "release" keys in the time search entry mode during replay,
  to avoid inadvertently leaving it in case a key is pressed too long (suggested
  by Andreas Brugger).
- Improved sending all frames to devices that can handle them in fast forward
  trick speeds, including subtitles (thanks to Timo Eskola).
- The section handler is now stopped before the device is destroyed, to avoid
  accessing file handles after they have become invalid (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl for reporting an invalid access when ending VDR, and to Deti Fliegl for
  a patch that was used to implement StopSectionHandler()).
- Fixed setting the date in the channel display of the classic and sttng skins,
  to avoid unnecessary OSD access (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- The free disk space is now also displayed in the title of the "Recordings"
  menu (suggested by Walter Koch).
- Changed the message "Upcoming VPS recording!" to "Upcoming recording!" because
  it applies to non-VPS recordings as well.
- Fixed a loss of a timer's 'recording' flag after modifying it via MODT.
- Fixed detecting directories in cFileNameList::Load().
- Running the thread that removes deleted recordings at a low priority to (maybe)
  avoid stuttering replay in case the thread is run during replay.
- Limiting the length of the recording name in timers in case VDR is run with
  --vfat, in order to avoid names that are too long for Windows (suggested by Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Using cString::sprintf() instead of asprintf() (thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald
  for pointing out a possible problem if the return value is not checked).
  Plugin authors may want to consider doing the same. For convenience there is now
  an additional version of cString::sprintf() that accepts a va_list parameter.
- When deleting the recording that is currently replayed, the replay is now
  stopped immediately (thanks to Mikko Matilainen for reporting a possible crash
  if the Info key is pressed after deleting the currently replayed recording).
- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- When determining the amount of free disk space, any deleted (but not yet removed)
  recordings on different file systems (that are mounted under the video directory)
  are no longer taken into account.
- When running out of disk space during a recording, only such deleted or old
  recordings are removed, that actually are on the video directory file system(s).
  This prevents VDR from accidentally deleting recordings on other file systems,
  which would not add any free space to the video directory.
- Implemented the cStatus, cDevice and cPlayer functions for setting subtitle tracks
  in plugins (thanks to Petri Hintukainen).
- Added cStatus::TimerChange() to inform plugins about changes to the list of timers
  (based on a patch from Benedikt Elser).
- Added new cStatus functions to the 'status' plugin.
- Added missing #include <limits.h> to epg.c and menuitems.h (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- The new function cSkin::SetScrollbar() can be implemented by skins to display
  a scrollbar in every list menu. The 'classic' and 'sttng' skins have been
  changed accordingly, as well as the 'skincurses' plugin.
- Introduced 'operator const void * ()' in cString to catch cases where operator*()
  should be used.
- Fixed calculating the scrollbar sizes in the skins.

2008-02-24: Version 1.5.16

- Fixed setting the current subtitle track in Transfer-Mode (reported by Petri Helin,
  thanks to Reinhard Nissl for pointing out that cDevice::Transferring() doesn't
  return the right value in the early stage of channel switching).
- Updated the Danish OSD texts (thanks to Mogens Elneff).
- Updated the Dutch OSD texts (thanks to Carel Willemse).
- Fixed various spelling errors and improved PLUGINS.html (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Fixed the format in cRemote::Put() to use "%016llX" instead of "%016LX" (thanks
  to Ludwig Nussel for pointing this out).
- Revised the fix of calculating the scrollbar height in the skins. The scrollbar
  handle now always has a height that is at least the width of the scrollbar.
- When switching the device that's used for live viewing away from the current
  transponder in favor of an upcoming recording, an attempt is now made to stay
  on the current channel by possibly going into 'Transfer Mode'.
- The CAM menu now stays open as long as it is automatically updated, even without
  pressing a remote control key. This is important when updating the CAM firmware
  from the transponder.
- No longer trying to switch to an available channel if the primary device has
  no valid programme and a menu is open (avoids interference with the CAM in
  case a CAM menu is open).
- Increased the valid range of the "Subtitle offset" setup option to -100...100
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added the backslash ('\') to the list of characters that need to be escaped
  when executing external commands (thanks to Peter Bieringer for reporting this one).

2008-03-02: Version 1.5.17

- Updated the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Tomas Berglund).
- Made the 'pic2mpg' script of the 'pictures' plugin work with uppercase filename
  extensions and relative paths (thanks to Stefan Wagner for reporting this one).
- Updated the Romanian OSD texts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Updated the Dutch OSD texts (thanks to Johan Schuring).
- Stripping control codes 0x86 and 0x87 from SI strings.
- Updated French language texts (thanks to Jean-Claude Repetto).
- Fixed handling 3 and 4 byte UTF-8 symbols in Utf8CharGet() (thanks to Andreas
  Mair).
- Fixed a crash in cFreetypeFont::DrawText() if an unknown symbol is encountered
  (thanks to Tobias Grimm). Unknown symbols are replaced with a '?'.
- Updated the Slovenian OSD texts (thanks to Matjaz Thaler).
- Updated the Czech OSD texts (thanks to Vladimír Bárta and Jiri Dobry).
- Updated the Turkish OSD texts (thanks to Oktay Yolgeçen).
- The 'plugins' target in the Makefile now returns an error exit code if one of the
  plugins failed to compile (suggested by Tobias Grimm).
- Rendering the non-breaking space symbol as a blank (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- Changed the default character set for SI data from ISO6937 (as required by the DVB
  standard ETSI EN 300 468) to ISO-8859-9, in order to work around the stupidity of
  some providers, who actually use ISO-8859-9, but fail to correctly announce that.

2008-03-16: Version 1.5.18

- Added a missing reset of maxNumber in cChannels::Renumber() (reported by Sundararaj
  Reel).
- Revoked the fixed change of the default character set for SI data and introduced
  an environment variable to control it (thanks to Ales Jurik for reporting broken
  SI data on the Czech/Slovak channels, which actually do follow the standard).
  Users who want to set the default character set to something different can do this
  by setting the environment variable VDR_CHARSET_OVERRIDE to something like
  ISO-8859-9.
- Fixed a signed character used as index in cBase64Encoder::NextLine() (thanks
  to Tobias Grimm).
- Updated the Spanish and Catalan OSD texts (thanks to Luca Olivetti).
- Fixed automatically selecting the preferred subtitle language (based on a patch
  from Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Updated the Ukrainian OSD texts (thanks to Yarema Aka Knedlyk).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Updated the Polish OSD texts (thanks to Michael Rakowski).
- Fixed formatting the name section in the VDR man pages (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- Updated the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Magnus Andersson).
- Added Russian translations to the 'skincurses' and 'pictures' plugins (thanks
  to Alexander Gross).
- Fixed displaying the free disk space when entering the recordings menu where the
  last replayed recording was in a subdirectory, and pressing Back (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Fixed tuning to a live channel after a recording has been stopped using the
  'Back' key.
- Resetting a timer's 'pending' flag when it has ended.

2008-03-23: Version 1.6.0

- Updated the Croatian language texts (thanks to Adrian Caval).
- Added Chinese language texts (thanks to Nan Feng).
- Updated the Portuguese language texts.
- Added a note about VDR_CHARSET_OVERRIDE to the INSTALL file.

2008-04-13: Version 1.7.0

- Re-implemented handling of DVB-S2, which first appeared in version 1.5.14, but was
  revoked in version 1.5.15 in favor of making a stable version 1.6.0. VDR now
  requires the "multiproto" DVB driver, e.g. from http://jusst.de/hg/multiproto.
  Note that the channels.conf file now supports additional parameters, so you may
  want to make sure you have a backup of this file in case you need to go back to
  the previous version of VDR!
- Fixed displaying transponder data when it is modified (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed handling the counter in detection of pre 1.3.19 PS data (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Improved logging system time changes to avoid problems on slow systems under
  heavy load (suggested by Helmut Auer).
- Now setting the thread name, so that it can be seen in 'top -H' (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Fixed initializing the timer's flags in the cTimer copy constructor (thanks to
  Andreas Mair).
- Fixed setting the OSD level in the 'osddemo' example (thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald).
- Increased the time between checking the CAM status to 500ms to avoid problems
  with some CAMs (reported by Arthur Konovalov).

2008-04-13: Version 1.6.0-1

- Fixed handling the counter in detection of pre 1.3.19 PS data (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Improved logging system time changes to avoid problems on slow systems under
  heavy load (suggested by Helmut Auer).
- Fixed initializing the timer's flags in the cTimer copy constructor (thanks to
  Andreas Mair).
- Increased the time between checking the CAM status to 500ms to avoid problems
  with some CAMs (reported by Arthur Konovalov).

2008-09-06: Version 1.7.1

- Adapted the tuning code to the new DVBFE_SET_DELSYS API (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
  VDR now uses the driver from http://jusst.de/hg/multiproto_plus.
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Removed obsolete $(NCURSESLIB) from the Makefile.
- Implemented handling the standard component descriptor for AC3 (stream=4), as it
  will soon be used by the German ARD channels (thanks to Michael Pennewiß for
  advance information about this change). The previously used "Premiere pseudo
  standard" (stream=2, type=5) still works, but has apparently been wrongfully used
  by broadcasters from the beginning.
- Added missing description of the 'S' channel parameter to vdr.5 (reported by
  Reinhard Nissl).
- The SVDRP signon message now indicates the character encoding in use, as in
  "220 video SVDRP VideoDiskRecorder 1.7.1; Fri May  2 16:17:10 2008; ISO-8859-1".
  This may be useful for instance for external tools that provide EPG data, so that
  they can correctly encode the strings.
- No longer calling FcFini() to avoid problems with older (broken) versions of
  fontconfig (suggested by Edgar Toernig).
- Removed the compile time option VFAT to allow users of precompiled binary
  distributions to have full control over whether or not to use the --vfat option
  at runtime (suggested by Michael Nork).
- First step towards switching to TS (Transport Stream) as recording format:
  + The new function cDevice::PlayTs() is used to play TS packets.
  + The new functions cDevice::PlayTsVideo() and cDevice::PlayTsAudio()
    are used to play video and audio TS packets, respectively.
  + The new function cAudio::PlayTs() is used to play audio TS packets.
  + The new class cPatPmtGenerator is used to generate a PAT/PMT pair that precedes
    the TS data in Transfer Mode.
  + The new class cPatPmtParser is used by cDevice to parse the PAT/PMT data in a
    TS in order to find out which streams it contains.
  + The new class cTsToPes is used to convert TS packets to a PES packet.
  + cTransfer no longer uses cRemux, and doesn't run a separate thread any more.
    It just generates a PAT/PMT and sends all received TS packets to the primary
    device's PlayTs().
  + Live subtitle display no longer uses a ring buffer and separate thread.
  + cPesAssembler has been removed. Old VDR recordings only contain complete PES
    packets.
  + Since a TS needs to have a PAT/PMT, which requires the video stream type to
    be explicitly given, the format of the VPID field in the channels.conf file
    and the SVDRP commands NEWC/MODC/LSTC has been extended. The video stream type
    now follows the VPID and optional PPID, separated by an '=' sign.
- Updated the sources.conf file (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Fixed a possible integer overflow in GetAbsTime() (thanks to Alexander Rieger).
- Fixed a problem with calling isyslog() from within the SignalHandler() (thanks
  to Udo Richter).
- Replaced the Finnish language code "smi" with "suo" (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed wrong value for TableIdBAT in libsi/si.h (thanks to Winfried Köhler).
- Errors in config files no longer keep VDR from starting.
- Removed unneeded include files <linux/dvb/dmx.h> and <time.h> from remux.h
  (reported by Tobias Grimm).

2008-09-06: Version 1.6.0-2

- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- The SVDRP signon message now indicates the character encoding in use, as in
  "220 video SVDRP VideoDiskRecorder 1.7.1; Fri May  2 16:17:10 2008; ISO-8859-1".
  This may be useful for instance for external tools that provide EPG data, so that
  they can correctly encode the strings.
- No longer calling FcFini() to avoid problems with older (broken) versions of
  fontconfig (suggested by Edgar Toernig).
- Updated the sources.conf file (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Fixed a possible integer overflow in GetAbsTime() (thanks to Alexander Rieger).
- Fixed a problem with calling isyslog() from within the SignalHandler() (thanks
  to Udo Richter).
- Replaced the Finnish language code "smi" with "suo" (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed wrong value for TableIdBAT in libsi/si.h (thanks to Winfried Köhler).
- Removed unneeded include files <linux/dvb/dmx.h> and <time.h> from remux.h
  (reported by Tobias Grimm).

2008-12-14: Version 1.7.2

- Added a note about 'Id' being obsolete to the description of cDevice::PlayAudio().
- Switched to the new S2API driver API, which was decided to become the official
  DVB API in the kernel (based on patches from Igor M. Liplianin, Niels Wagenaar
  and Edgar Hucek). VDR now uses the S2API driver from http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb.
  In order to correctly detect DVB-S2 capable devices, you need to apply the patch
  from ftp://ftp.tvdr.de/vdr/Developer/v4l-dvb-s2api-add-s2-capability.diff to
  the driver source, because the S2API doesn't provide a way of telling whether a
  device can handle DVB-S2 transponders.
- The cDvbTuner::IsTunedTo() function now also checks the symbol rate in case of
  DVB-S and DVB-C.
- Improved handling PES video packets with zero length when converting from TS to PES.
  For good replay in Transfer Mode on full featured DVB cards you may want to apply
  the patch from ftp://ftp.tvdr.de/vdr/Developer/av7110_v4ldvb_api5_audiobuf_test_1.diff
  to the driver (thanks to Oliver Endriss).

2009-01-06: Version 1.7.3

- Updated the Russian OSD texts (thanks to Oleg Roitburd).
- Fixed handling the 'pointer field' in generating and parsing PAT/PMT (thanks to
  Frank Schmirler).
- Fixed handling modulation types for DVB-S transponders when processing the NIT.
- Changed cDvbDevice::GrabImage() to use V4L2 (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Added a poll to cDvbDevice::PlayVideo() and cDvbDevice::PlayAudio() to avoid
  excessive CPU load (this is just a makeshift solution until the FF DVB cards
  can play TS directly).
- The recording format is now Transport Stream. Existing recordings in PES format
  can still be replayed and edited, but new recordings are done in TS.
  All code for recording in PES has been removed.
  The following changes were made to switch to TS recording format:
  + The index file format has been changed to support file sizes of up to 1TB
    (previously 2GB), and up to 65535 separate files per recording (previously
    255).
  + The recording file names are now of the form 00001.ts (previously 001.vdr).
  + The frame rate is now detected by looking at two subsequent PTS values.
    The "frames per second" is stored in the "info" file using the new tag F
    (thanks to Artur Skawina for helping to get the IndexToHMSF() calculation
    right).
  + Several functions now have an additional parameter FramesPerSecond.
  + Several functions now have an additional parameter IsPesRecording.
  + The functionality of cFileWriter was moved into cRecorder, and cRemux is
    now obsolete. This also avoids one level of data copying while recording.
  + cRemux, cRingBufferLinearPes, cTS2PES and all c*Repacker classes have been
    removed.
  + A PAT/PMT is inserted before every independent frame, so that no extra
    measures need to be taken when editing a recording.
  + The directory name for a recording has been changed from
    YYYY-MM-DD-hh[.:]mm.pr.lt.rec (pr=priority, lt=lifetime) to
    YYYY-MM-DD-hh.mm.ch-ri.rec (ch=channel, ri=resumeId).
    Priority and Lifetime are now stored in the "info" file with the new
    tags P and L (if no such file exists, the maximum values are assumed by
    default, which avoids inadvertently deleting a recording if disk space
    is low). No longer storing Priority and Lifetime in the directory name
    avoids starting a new recording if one of these is changed in the timer
    and the recording is re-started for some reason.
    Instead of Priority and Lifetime, the directory name now contains the
    channel number from which the recording was made, and the "resume id" of
    this instance of VDR. This avoids problems if several VDR instances record
    the same show on different channels, or even on the same channel.
    The '-' between channel number and resumeId prevents older versions of
    VDR from "seeing" these recordings, which makes sure they won't even try
    to replay them, or remove them in case the disk runs full.
  + The semantics of PlayTs*() have been changed. These functions are now
    required to return the given Length (which is TS_SIZE) if they have
    processed the TS packet.
  + The files "index", "info", "marks" and "resume" within a TS recording
    directory are now created without the ".vdr" extension.
  + The "resume" file is no longer a binary file, but contains tagged lines
    to be able to store additional information, like the selected audio or
    subtitle track.
  + cDevice::StillPicture() will now be called with either TS or PES data.
  + cDvbPlayer::Goto() no longer appends a "sequence end code" to the data.
    If the output device needs this, it has to take care of it by itself.
- Fixed cPatPmtParser::ParsePmt() to reset vpid and vtype when switching from
  a video to an audio channel (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- cDvbDevice now uses the FE_CAN_2G_MODULATION flag to determine whether a device
  can handle DVB-S2. The #define is still there to allow people with older drivers
  who don't need DVB-S2 to use this version without patching.

2009-01-25: Version 1.7.4

- Removed the '#define FE_CAN_2ND_GEN_MODULATION', since it was wrong and the
  flag is now in the driver, anyway.
- The full-featured DVB cards are now given the TS data directly for replay
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss for enhancing the av7110 driver to make it replay
  TS data). The patch from ftp://ftp.tvdr.de/vdr/Developer/av7110_ts_replay__1.diff
  implements this change in the driver.
  The patch av7110_v4ldvb_api5_audiobuf_test_1.diff mentioned in version 1.7.2
  is still necessary to avoid audio and video glitches on some channels.
- Added a typecast in cUnbufferedFile::Write() to avoid an error message when
  compiling on 64 bit systems.
- Added some missing 'const' statements to cBitmap (thanks to Andreas Regel).
- Fixed returning complete PES packets in cTsToPes::GetPes() (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Added a missing Detach() in cTransfer::Activate() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Added clearing the TS buffers in cDevice::Detach() (thanks to Marco Schlüßler).
- Fixed incrementing the continuity counter in cPatPmtGenerator::GetPmt() (thanks
  to Johann Friedrichs).
- Fixed removing deleted recordings in case there is a problem. Once a recording
  caused a problem with removing, no others were removed any more and an ongoing
  recording could fill up the disk and cause other recordings to be deleted
  automatically (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- Added "DEFINES += -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE"
  to Make.config.template (thanks to Johann Friedrichs for pointing this out).
  Plugin authors should add this line to their Makefile or Make.config if they use
  file access functions that need special versions for 64 bit offsets.
- The new command line option -i can be used to set an "instance id", which will
  be used to distinguish recordings of the same broadcast made by different instances
  of VDR (suggested by Frank Schmirler). This replaces the use of the "resume id"
  that was introduced in version 1.7.3.
- Added checking mutexCurrentAudioTrack to cDevice::PlayTs() (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl for pointing this out).
- Fixed handling the pointer field in cPatPmtParser::ParsePmt() (thanks to Frank
  Schmirler - sorry I swapped two lines when adopting the original patch).
- Checking the remaining packet length after processing the pointer field in
  cPatPmtParser::ParsePat() and cPatPmtParser::ParsePmt() (suggested by Frank
  Schmirler).
- Checking the pointer field in cPatPmtParser::ParsePmt() only in 'payload start'
  packets (suggested by Frank Schmirler).
- Changed cPatPmtGenerator to make sure the PMT pid doesn't collide with any of
  the actual pids of the channel.
- Fixed cDevice::PlayTsAudio() and made cDevice::PlayTsVideo() return 0 if
  PlayVideo() didn't play anything.
- Added an 'int' typecast to calculations involving FramesPerSecond() to avoid
  compiler warnings (reported by Winfried Koehler).
- Fixed detecting frames for pure audio recordings.
- Fixed editing PES recordings. The frame type in the index.vdr file generated for
  the edited PES recording is set to 1 for I-frames and 2 for all others (P- and
  B-frames). The exact frame type doesn't matter for VDR, it only needs to know if
  it's an I-frame or not.
- The PAT/PMT is now only processed if its version changes (reported by Reinhard
  Nissl).
- Fixed handling the maximum video file size (reported by Udo Richter).
- Improved fast-forward/-rewind for audio recordings. The actual data is now sent
  to the output device, so that it can be replayed and thus cause the proper delay.
  For pure audio recordings the audio is no longer muted in fast-forward/-rewind
  mode, so that some orientation regarding the position within the recording is
  possible. There may still be some offset in the replay position displayed by the
  progress indicator when switching from fast-forward/-rewind to play mode, as well
  as in the current position during normal play mode. This is due to the various
  buffers between the player and the output device and will be addressed later.
  Note the new function cDevice::IsPlayingVideo(), which is used to inform the
  player whether there is video data in the currently replayed stream. If a derived
  cDevice class reimplements PlayTs() or PlayPes(), it also needs to make sure this
  new function works as expected.

2009-04-12: Version 1.7.5

- Fixed a hangup when replaying a TS recording with subtitles activated (reported
  by Timo Helkio).
- Fixed handling the 'new' indicator in the recordings menu for TS recordings
  (thanks to Derek Kelly).
- Added cap_sys_nice to the capabilities that are not dropped (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Added cRecordingInfo::GetEvent() (thanks to Marcel Unbehaun).
- Improved synchronizing the progress display, trick modes and subtitle display
  to the actual audio/video. This now works independent of any buffer sizes the
  output device might use.
  + The cBackTrace class has been replaced with cPtsIndex, which keeps track
    of the PTS timestamps of recently played frames.
  + cDevice::GetSTC() is now required to deliver the STC even in trick modes.
    It is sufficient if it returns the PTS of the most recently presented
    audio/video frame.
  + The full-featured DVB cards need an improved firmware in order to return
    proper STC values in trick modes (thanks to Oliver Endriss for enhancing the
    av7110 firmware).
- Adapted cFrameDetector::Analyze() to HD NTSC broadcasts that split frames over
  several payload units (thanks to Derek Kelly for reporting this and helping in
  testing).
- Modified cFrameDetector::Analyze() to make it process whole frames at once, so
  that file I/O overhead is minimized during recording (reported by Günter
  Niedermeier).
- Added command line help for the '-i' option.
- Fixed cDvbPlayer::NextFile() to handle files larger than 2GB (thanks to Jose
  Alberto Reguero).
- Improved replay at the begin and end of a recording. The very first and very last
  frame is now sent to the output device repeatedly until GetSTC() reports that it
  has been played. cDvbPlayer::Action() no longer calls DeviceFlush() (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl for making sure vdr-xine no longer needs this).
- Added missing '[]' to the delete operator in cMenuEditStrItem::~cMenuEditStrItem().
- Added missing virtual destructor to cPalette.
- Now freeing configDirectory before setting it to a new value in
  cPlugin::SetConfigDirectory().
- Fixed a crash when jumping to an editing mark in an audio recording.
- Fixed the 'VideoOnly' condition in the PlayPes() and PlayTs() calls in
  cDvbPlayer::Action() (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- cDevice::PlayTs() now plays as many TS packets as possible in one call.
- Making sure any floating point numbers written use a decimal point (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss for pointing out a problem with the F record in the info file of
  a recording).
- Fixed detecting the frame rate for radio recordings.
- Added missing AUDIO_PAUSE/AUDIO_CONTINUE calls to cDvbDevice (thanks to Oliver
  Endriss).
- No longer writing the video type into channels.conf if VPID is 0 (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss for reporting this).
- Improved efficiency of cEIT::cEIT() (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).

2009-04-26: Version 1.7.6

- cDevice::PlayTs() now syncs on the TS packet sync bytes.
- Made MAXFRAMESIZE a multiple of TS_SIZE to avoid breaking up TS packets.
- No longer resetting the patPmtParser in cDevice::PlayTs(), because this
  caused the selected audio and subtitle tracks to fall back to the default.
- The SVDRP command PUTE now supports reading the EPG data from a given file
  (thanks to Helmut Auer).
- Added cThread::SetIOPriority() and using it in cRemoveDeletedRecordingsThread
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed the MEGABYTE() macro to make it correctly handle parameters resulting in
  values larger than 2GB.
- Added cDevice::NumProvidedSystems() to PLUGINS.html (was missing since it had
  been implemented).
- Fixed distortions when switching to the next file during replay.
- Fixed detecting the frame rate for streams with PTS distances of 1800, which
  apparently split one frame over two payload units.
- Added missing 'const' to cRecording::FramesPerSecond() (thanks to Joachim Wilke).
- Any TS packets in the first "frame" after a cut in an edited recording that don't
  belong to a payload unit that started in that frame now get their TEI flag set,
  so that a decoder will ignore them together with any PES data collected for that
  PID so far (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting chirping sound disturbances at
  editing points in TS recordings).
- cDvbPlayer::Empty() subtracts 1 from readIndex, because Action() will first
  increment it.
- Only storing non-zero Pts values in ptsIndex.
- Added a note to the INSTALL file about using subdirectories to split a large
  disk into separate areas for VDR's video data and other stuff (suggested by
  Udo Richter).

2009-05-03: Version 1.7.7

- The new function cDevice::GetVideoSize() returns the size and aspect ratio
  of the video material currently displayed. This function is used to determine
  the proper size of the OSD. Plugin authors should implement this function in
  classes derived from cDevice, if they are able to replay video.
- The OSD and font sizes are now defined in percent of the actual video display
  size. The maximum OSD size has been raised to 1920x1080, to allow full
  screen OSD on HD systems.
- The OSD size is now automatically adjusted to the actual video display
  (provided the output device implements the GetVideoSize() function).
- cFrameDetector::Analyze() now syncs on the TS packet sync bytes (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss for reporting broken index generation after a buffer overflow).

2009-06-13: Version 1.7.8

- The name of the function cDevice::GetVideoSize() wasn't very well chosen
  for its purpose of defining the optimum size of the OSD for the current
  output device. Therefore a new function named cDevice::GetOsdSize() has
  been introduced (suggested by Rolf Ahrenberg). Plugin authors should
  implement this function in classes derived from cDevice, if they are able
  to replay video. cDevice::GetVideoSize() still exists and should return the
  actual size of the video material that is currently replayed. Note that
  because of the many possible aspect ratios for video material, the type
  of the Aspect parameter of GetVideoSize() has been changed to 'double',
  and the Aspect parameter in both functions is named differently, because
  it returns different values (suggested by Reinhard Nissl).
  Thanks to Oliver Endriss for his input on calculating the Aspect factor in
  GetOsdSize().
- Fixed the way the OSD size is determined on full featured DVB cards (thanks
  to Oliver Endriss).
- Increased MAXOSDHEIGHT to 1200 (suggested by Nicolas Huillard).
- Removed limitation to PAL resolution from SPU handling.
- Checking fd_video in cDvbDevice::GetVideoSize() to avoid error messages on
  systems with no real primary replay device (reported by Martin Neuditschko).
- Added a note to cTsToPes::GetPes() about having to call it repeatedly, once
  it has returned a non-NULL value.
- Added MPEG 1 handling to remux.c (thanks to Ales Jurik).
- Fixed use of time_t in cEIT::cEIT() (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).
- Added missing update of lastOsdSizeUpdate.
- EIT events are now only processed if a plausible system time is available, to
  avoid wrong handling of PDC descriptors (thanks to Tobias Bratfisch).
- Removed unused 'synced' member from cTsToPes (reported by Christoph Haubrich).
- Added a note to cTsToPes about all TS packets having to belong to the same PID,
  and that for video data GetPes() may only be called if the next TS packet that
  will be given to PutTs() has the "payload start" flag set (suggested by Christoph
  Haubrich).
- Added a note about the meaning of PERCENTAGEDELTA in cRingBuffer::UpdatePercentage()
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The new setup option "Recording/Pause key handling" can be used to define
  what happens if the Pause key on the remote control is pressed during
  live tv (thanks to Timo Eskola).
- Added a note about cFont::GetFont() not being thread-safe.
- Fixed generating PAT/PMT version numbers in case the PIDs change during
  recording (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- Updated the Ukrainian OSD texts (thanks to Yarema Aka Knedlyk).
- Fixed a memory leak when reaching the end of a recording during replay (reported
  by Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed calling close(-1) in cUnbufferedFile::Close() (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- Added a workaround for the broken linux-dvb driver header files (based on a patch
  from Tobias Grimm).
- Fixed handling the length of DiSEqC command sequences (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed cOsdMenu::Display() in case the menu size has changed (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Added some missing 'const' keywords to avoid compilation errors with gcc 4.4
  (thanks to Ville Skyttä and Ludwig Nussel).
- Modified cSVDRP::CmdGRAB() to avoid writing into const data (reported by
  Ludwig Nussel).
- Fixed calculating menu colum widths in case the font has a size other than the
  default size (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- Added a plausibility check for the OSD percentage parameters
  to avoid problems in case the values are stored in the setup.conf
  file in a wrong way.
- Fixed variable types in cIndexFile (reported by Udo Richter).

2009-08-23: Version 1.7.9

- Fixed storing the current OSD size in case the device has
  changed it in its setup menu (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed cDevice::PlayTsVideo() and cDevice::PlayTsAudio() in case only part of the
  buffer has been accepted by the device (reported by Udo Richter).
- Changed the EIT filter setup to save a few handles on devices that do hardware
  filtering.
- Fixed deleting expired timers if they have the VPS flag set, but the event they
  are assigned to doesn't have a VPS tag.
- Fixed handling file name length on VFAT systems in case they
  contain UTF-8 characters (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed generating CaPmts in case audio and video are encrypted using different
  ECM pids.
- Updated vdr.1 to use the new file names in recording directories.
- Fixed cRecordings::DelByName() to avoid compilation errors with gcc 4.4
  (thanks to Matthias Schwarzott).
- Increased the value of MAXFRAMESIZE to better suit HD recordings (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- Implemented full handling of subtitling descriptors (thanks to Mikko Tuumanen).

2009-11-22: Version 1.7.10

- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Fixed wrong bracketing in cChannel::SubtitlingType() etc.
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed not logging changes for channels that have no number
  (reported by Timothy D. Lenz).
- Changed the project's URLs and email to tvdr.de.
- Added Lithuanian language translations (thanks to Valdemaras Pipiras).
- Updated Chinese language texts (thanks to Nan Feng).
- Only checking DVB_API_VERSION to be >=5 in order to stay compileable in case
  the DVB API version number is increased (the API claims to always be backward
  compatible).
- Fixed saving terminal settings when running in background (thanks to Manuel
  Reimer).
- Fixed cFrameDetector::Analyze() to handle video streams where the frame type
  is not detectable from the first TS packet of a frame.
- Fixed writing the PCR pid into the PMT in cPatPmtGenerator::GeneratePmt()
  (reported by Rene van den Braken).
- Added Slovakian language texts (thanks to Milan Hrala).
- Fixed EntriesOnSameFileSystem() to avoid using f_fsid, which may be 0 (thanks
  to Frank Schmirler).
- Fixed starting a recording at an I-frame.
- Fixed generating the index for recordings from channels that put a whole
  GOP into one payload unit.
- The index file for TS recordings is now regenerated on-the-fly if a
  recording is replayed that has no index. This can also be used to
  re-create a broken index file by manually deleting the index file and then
  replaying the recording (at least until the index file has been generated).
- The cRingBufferLinear::Read() function now returns -1 and sets errno to
  EAGAIN if the buffer is already full.
- Fixed handling DVB subtitles for PES recordings (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added the audio id to the call of PlayAudio() in cDevice::PlayTsAudio()
  (thanks to Andreas Schaefers).
- Fixed references to old *.vdr file names in MANUAL (reported by Arthur Konovalov).
- Reverted "Removed limitation to PAL resolution from SPU handling" because it
  cause nothing but trouble. Besides, the core VDR doesn't use this, anyway.
- Fixed the default value for "Pause key handling" in the MANUAL (reported by
  Diego Pierotto).

2010-01-06: Version 1.7.11

- Fixed resetting the file size when regenerating the index file.
- The new function cDevice::PatPmtParser() can be used in derived devices to access
  the PAT/PMT of the currently replayed material.
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- The PCR pid in generated PMTs is now set to 0x1FFF ("no PCR pid") in
  cPatPmtGenerator::GeneratePmt(), because VDR doesn't record the PCR pid.
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- The 'sky' plugin is no longer part of the VDR source.
- Improved SPU handling on devices with limited OSD capabilities (thanks to
  Matthieu Castet).
- Several code modifications to avoid compiler warnings (thanks to Winfried Köhler).
- Added stream type 11172 AUDIO to cPatPmtParser::ParsePmt() (thanks to Johann
  Friedrichs).
- Removed debug output of '-' from cTransfer::Receive().
- Added defines for large files to the 'newplugin' script (reported by Udo Richter).
- Removed the workaround for short channel names of "Kabel Deutschland", because
  apparently they now have their data according to the DVB standard (thanks to
  Johann Friedrichs).
- Some fixes to dvbspu.[hc] (thanks to Johann Friedrichs).
- Fixed a busy loop when moving editing marks (thanks to Johann Friedrichs).
- Updated sources.conf (thanks to Derek Kelly).
- Modified cCharSetConv so that it can be used to convert from "whatever VDR uses"
  to a given code (thanks to Joachim Wilke).
- Channel names containing commas are now handled correctly in channels.conf.
  If a channel's short name contains a comma, it is replaced with a '.'.
- cDevice now logs the device number when a new device is created.
- Fixed handling STREAMTYPE_11172_AUDIO in cPatPmtParser::ParsePmt().
- cParsePatPmt now has functions to retrieve the audio, dolby and subtitle pids.
- cPatFilter::Process() now only stores CA descriptors for video and audio pids
  (thanks to Francesco Saverio Schiavarelli for reporting a problem with channels
  that have some encrypted components that VDR doesn't use).
- cDevice::AddPid() now stores the stream type of the given pid (thanks to Andreas
  Regel).
- Added cFont::FontName() and cFont::Size() (thanks to Andreas Regel).
- cPatPmtParser now also stores the audio stream types.
- The support for full featured DVB cards of the TT/FuSi design has been moved
  into the new plugin 'dvbsddevice'. On systems that use such a card as their
  primary device, this plugin now needs to be loaded when running VDR in order
  to view live or recorded video. If the plugin is not loaded, the card will
  be treated like a budget DVB card, and there will be no OSD or viewing
  capability.
- Fixed handling the "CA PMT" generation (revised a change not mentioned in version
  1.7.9's changes, which caused a malfunction with Conax and Viaccess CAMs).
- Fixed stopping subtitle display when switching the primary device (thanks to
  Anssi Hannula).
  IMPORTANT NOTE TO PLUGIN AUTHORS: a plugin that implements a derived cDevice
  class that can replay video must now call the MakePrimaryDevice() function of
  its base class.
- Fixed compiler warnings "format not a string literal and no format arguments"
  in some syslog calls (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The new command line options --edit and --genindex can be used to edit a
  recording or generate its index without actually starting the entire VDR
  (based on a patch from Helmut Auer).
- Improved the description of the transponder parameters in vdr.5 (thanks to
  Winfried Köhler).
- Avoiding setting the video stream type to 2 if the vpid is 0 (problem reported
  by Arthur Konovalov).
- Implemented handling the "Content Descriptor" (based on a patch from Rolf
  Ahrenberg). The 'classic', 'sttng' and 'curses' skins display the textual
  representation of the content descriptors as "genre". The epg.data file stores
  the genre using the tag character 'G'.
- Implemented handling the "Parental Rating Descriptor" (based on a patch from Rolf
  Ahrenberg). The 'classic', 'sttng' and 'curses' skins display the parental
  rating (if given) in their event displays. The epg.data file stores
  the parental rating using the tag character 'R'.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: if VDR doesn't display a parental rating, this does not
  necessarily mean that the given programme is suitable for all audiences!
- Rearranged cEvent members to minimize memory waste.
- After a CLRE command, no further EPG processing is now done for 10 seconds,
  so that data sent with subsequent PUTE commands doesn't interfere with data
  from the broadcasters (suggested by Helmut Auer).
- Added support for DVB cards with multiple fontends. Note that this only
  works for DVB cards where each frontend can be used independently of all
  the others on the same adapter.
- Fixed plugin arguments corruption with glibc 2.11 on x86_64 (thanks to
  Anssi Hannula).

2010-01-31: Version 1.7.12

- Changed the EVCONTENTMASK_* macros to enums and changed "mask" to "group".
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- The "Edit timer" menu can now set the folder for the recording from a list of
  folders stored in "folders.conf".
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- If svdrphosts.conf contains only the address of the local host, the SVDRP port
  is opened only for the local host (thanks to Manuel Reimer).
- Renamed 'runvdr' to 'runvdr.template' and no longer copying it to the BINDIR
  in 'make install' (thanks to Martin Dauskardt).
- Added plain text error messages to log entries from cOsd::SetAreas() (suggested
  by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- cPalette::ClosestColor() now treats fully transparent colors as "equal"; improved
  cDvbSpuBitmap::getMinBpp() (thanks to Matthieu Castet and Johann Friedrichs).
- The new setup option "Miscellaneous/Channels wrap" controls whether the current
  channel wraps around the beginning or end of the channel list when zapping (thanks
  to Matti Lehtimäki).
- Fixed determining the frame duration on channels where the PTS deltas jitter by
  +/-1 around 1800.
- The PCR pid in generated PMTs is now set to the channel's PCR pid again.
- Fixed determining the frame duration on channels where the PTS deltas jitter by
  +/-1 around 3600.
- The PCR pid is now recorded for channels where this is different from the video
  PID. To facilitate this, the interfaces of cTransfer, cTransferControl, cRecorder
  and cReceiver have been modified, so that the PIDs are no longer given in separate
  parameters, but rather the whole channel is handed down for processing. The old
  constructor of cReceiver is still available, but it is recommended to plugin authors
  that they switch to the new interface as soon as possible.
  When replaying such a recording, the PCR packets are sent to PlayTsVideo().
- The files "commands.conf" and "reccmd.conf" can now contain nested lists of
  commands. See vdr.5 for information about the new file format.
  This obsoletes the CMDSUBMENU patch.

2010-02-28: Version 1.7.13

- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Changed the position of Sirius 4 to S4.8E in sources.conf (thanks to Alexander Gross).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Moved the declaration of cMenuCommands to menu.h, so that plugins can use it.
- Added a note to the MANUAL, saying that adding new transponders only works if the
  "EPG scan" is active (suggested by Halim Sahin).
- Improved handling frames at the beginning and end of a recording in cDvbPlayer for
  devices with large buffers (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Implemented cDeviceHook to allow plugins more control over which device can
  provide which transponder (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Implemented cDevice::GetCurrentlyTunedTransponder() (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Moved strictly necessary Makefile options into Make.global, which is included
  by all plugins (thanks to Paul Menzel). The Makefiles of existing plugins should be
  modified like this:

- Added device definitions to the diseqc.conf file format, so that certain satellite
  positions can be limited to a given list of devices.
  This obsoletes the SOURCECAPS patch.
- Keeping subtitles visible when pausing replay (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed adding new transponders in case there is only a single channel in the
  channel list (reported by Halim Sahin).
- The file name in the "Timers" menu now shows only the base name of the recording
  without the folder path (if any). Otherwise with long folder paths the actual
  recording name was not visible at all.
- Updated the Romanian OSD texts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Exported some libsi functions (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Improved scalability of the default skins.
- Fixed the German translation of "Folder name must not contain '%c'!" (thanks to
  Frank Schmirler).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Plugins can now define new sources. In order to implement this, the following
  changes were made:
  + The transponder parameter string is no longer interpreted by cChannel, but rather
    stored as is and used only by the respective device. That way plugins can use a
    channel's parameter string to store arbitrary data (see vdr.5).
  + The new class cSourceParam can be used by plugins to define new sources, and to
    implement OSD items that will be used in the channel editor for editing the source
    specific parameters of a channel (see dvbdevice.c for an example of how this is
    done for the default DVB devices).
  + Purely numerical values are no longer accepted in the 'source' parameter of a
    channel.
  This obsoletes the PLUGINPARAM patch.
- Updated the Lithuanian OSD texts (thanks to Valdemaras Pipiras).
- cSafeFile::Close() now flushes the file (suggested by Stephan Austermühle).
- The option "Setup/DVB/Use Dolby Digital" now only controls whether Dolby Digital
  tracks appear in the "Audio" menu. Dolby Digital is always recorded.
  This obsoletes the DOLBYINREC patch.

2010-03-12: Version 1.7.14

- Fixed handling empty strings in cSource::FromString().
- Assigned the source character 'I' to "IPTV" (suggested by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Assigned the source character 'V' to "Analog Video" (suggested by Lars Hanisch).
  This obsoletes the ANALOGTV patch.
- Added support for ATSC devices (thanks to Alex Lasnier).
  This obsoletes the ATSC patch.
- The "Source" item in the "Edit channel" menu now wraps around the list of sources
  (suggested by Halim Sahin).
- Fixed editing channel parameters.
- The new setup option "Recording/Delete timeshift recording" controls whether a timeshift
  recording is automatically deleted after viewing it.
  This obsoletes the DELTIMESHIFTREC patch.
  Note that the meaning of the values for this option is different from the DELTIMESHIFTREC
  patch: 0 means timeshift recordings are not automatically deleted (the default behavior
  as in previous versions), while 1 means to ask the user whether the recording shall be
  deleted.
- Added cChannel::IsSourceType() to test if a channel's source is of a given type.
- Changed the polarization characters in cDvbSourceParam::GetOsdItem() to uppercase.
- The full timer file name is now displayed if it ends with "TITLE" or "EPISODE"
  (pointed out by Udo Richter).
- Fixed "attempt to drop wrong frame from ring buffer" when skipping +/- one minute
  during replay.
- The new setup option "Folders in timer menu" controls whether the file names in
  the timer menu are shown with their full folder path.

2010-06-06: Version 1.7.15

- Added Macedonian language texts (thanks to Dimitar Petrovski).
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added handling of EnhancedAC3DescriptorTag (thanks to Eric Valette).
- The default SVDRP port is now 6419 (registered with ICANN/IANA by Christian Tramnitz).
  Use '-p 2001' to switch back to the old port if necessary.
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- cDvbDevice::ProvidesTransponder() now checks the modulation capabilities of the
  device (as far as the driver allows this).
- Fixed cFrameDetector::Analyze() in case part of the data has been processed and
  there is less than MIN_TS_PACKETS_FOR_FRAME_DETECTOR left (reported by Derek Kelly).
- Added a note about not deleting cDeviceHook objects to device.h.
- Added user defined key kUser0 (suggested by Ulf Kiener).
- Include paths are no longer overwritten in the Makefile (thanks
  to Paul Menzel).
- The various modulation types are now taken into account when selecting a device for
  a recording or live viewing, so that devices that provide more capabilities are
  spared.
- Fixed generating PMT language descriptors for multi language PIDs (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Transponders that use "8psk turbo fec" (a non-standard mode used by North American
  providers) are now identified by assuming that all 8psk transponders on DVB-S use
  "turbo fec". In order to determine whether a certain device can handle "turbo fec",
  the new driver flag FE_CAN_TURBO_FEC is checked. If your device can handle "turbo
  fec", and your driver doesn't have that flag, yet, you can apply the patch from
  ftp://ftp.tvdr.de/vdr/Developer/v4l-dvb-add-FE_CAN_TURBO_FEC.diff. A temporary
  macro in dvbdevice.c defines the flag for all those who don't need this in the
  driver, so that they can continue using an unmodified driver.
  Thanks to Derek Kelly for testing this.
- Updated the Ukrainian OSD texts (thanks to Yarema Aka Knedlyk).
- Fixed handling "none" color entries in XPM files (thanks to Thomas Günther).
- Fixed a crash when creating a new channel if the channel list is empty (reported
  by Halim Sahin).
- Updated the Czech OSD texts (thanks to Radek Stastny).
- Fixed a possible out of buffer memory access in case of bad TS data (reported
  by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Implemented handling of HD resolution subtitles according to v1.3.1 of
  ETSI EN 300 743, chapter 7.2.1 (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The EPG data now handles stream components 5 (H.264-video) and 6 (HEAAC-audio).
- Fixed a problem with external Dolby Digital processing via the '-a' option in live
  mode and with TS recordings (reported by Christopher Reimer).
- Added handling MPEG audio types "ISO/IEC 14496-3 Audio with LATM transport syntax"
  and "ISO/IEC 13818-7 Audio with ADTS transport syntax" (suggested by Luis Fernandes).
  See man vdr(5) on how the APID section of channels has been extended to store
  this information.
- Added detecting channels that use service type 0x16.
- Added full handling of the stream types of Dolby Digital pids
  (thanks to Jose Alberto Reguero).
- The new setup option "OSD/Number keys for characters" can be used to control whether
  the number keys can be used to enter characters in a text input field (suggested
  by Stefan Huskamp).

2010-09-19: Version 1.7.16

- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Added missing Dtypes for ATSC (thanks to Alex Lasnier).
- Updated the Portuguese language texts (thanks to Cristiano A. Silva).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed the array size of Atypes in cPatFilter::Process() (thanks to
  Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added locking to the cCutter functions to avoid a crash in case CutRecording()
  is called from a plugin (reported by Andreas Mair).
- Fixed DDS detection for HD resolution subtitles (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed following symbolic links in RemoveFileOrDir().
- Added support for languages that are written right-to-left (based on a patch
  from Osama Alrawab). See INSTALL for information on how to turn this on.
- Added Arabian language texts (thanks to Osama Alrawab).

2011-03-12: Version 1.7.17

- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Fixed following symbolic links in RemoveFileOrDir() (cont'd) (thanks to
  Steffen Barszus).
- Changed the description of cDevice::GetSTC() to make it mandatory for devices
  that can replay.
- Removed the check for positive STC values from cDvbSubtitleConverter::Action().
- Added cString::operator=(const char *String) (suggested by Antti Seppälä).
- Some spelling fixes (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Passing package name and version to xgettext (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Made 'dist' target dependent on up to date *.po (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Added Language and fixed Language-Team header of *.po (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Updated the Lithuanian OSD texts (thanks to Valdemaras Pipiras).
- Fixed detecting frames on channels that broadcast with 50 or 60 fps.
  This avoids artifacts during fast forward/rewind when replaying recordings from such
  channels. To fix the index of existing recordings from such channels, just delete the
  'index' file of the recording and VDR will generate a new one the next time you play it.
  You should also change the line "F 25" to "F 50" in the 'info' file of that recording.
- Added support for "registration descriptor" to 'libsi' and using it in pat.c (thanks
  to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed unjustified log entries about changed channel pids (reported by Derek Kelly).
- Added an include of VDR's 'Make.global' to libsi's Makefile (thanks to Rolf
  Ahrenberg).
- Removed displaying the "contents" information from the "Classic VDR" and
  "ST:TNG Panels" skins, because it is often wrong and nothing but irritating.
- Added typecasts to avoid gcc 4.5 warnings in switch statements on eKeys
  variables where additional 'k_...' flags are used.
- Fixed inclusion of <stdarg.h> (thanks to Henning Heinold).
- Changed "frame duration" to "frame rate" in vdr.5 (reported by Tobias Grimm).
- Removing a cRemote from the Remotes list in case its initialization failed (thanks
  to Dominik Strasser).
- Added LDFLAGS to the linker calls in the Makefiles (thanks to Joerg Bornkessel and
  Paul Menzel).
- Now updating the 'frames per second' data in the list of recordings when a new
  recording is started that has a frame rate other than the default.
- The include path to the freetype2 header files is now retrieved via a call to
  'pkg-config --cflags freetype2' (suggested by Andreas Oberritter).
- The OSD now has full TrueColor support. There can be several "pixmaps" that can
  be overlayed with alpha blending. All existing skins should work out of the box
  with the TrueColor OSD - the only exception being cOsd::GetBitmap(). Since the
  TrueColor OSD doesn't use bitmaps, this function will return a dummy bitmap, which
  may not be what the plugin expects. As long as this bitmap is only used for setting
  the palette, there is no problem. However, any other operations on this bitmap will
  have no effect. See the description of the cPixmap functions in osd.h for details
  about the new functionalities.
  The "ST:TNG Panels" skin has been enhanced to automatically use the TrueColor OSD
  if available.
  The "osddemo" plugin has been extended to show some of the possibilities of the
  TrueColor OSD if it is run on a system that actually provides TrueColor support.
  Thanks to Reinhard Nissl for some valuable input, help with debugging, and an
  implementation of the AlphaBlend() function.
- Updated the Slovakian language texts (thanks to Milan Hrala).
- Added Serbian language texts (thanks to Milan Cvijanovic).
- Fixed reallocating memory in the "pictures" plugin (reported by Paul Menzel, with
  input from Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed reallocating memory in cTsToPes::PutTs() (suggested by Oliver Endriss).
- Now checking the result of all realloc() calls.
- Fixed setting up the 'Recordings' menu in case there are several recordings
  with exactly the same name (reported by Marcus Hilbrich).
- Setting the audio type of language descriptors to 0x00 in the PAT/PMT generator
  (thanks to Anssi Hannula).
- Changed the compiler optimization flag to -O3, which gives quite a performance
  boost in the AlphaBlend() function.
- While replaying, the editing marks are now updated every 10 seconds (based on a
  patch from Manuel Reimer).
- Now reducing the thread and I/O priority cCuttingThread::Action() to make the
  foreground process more responsive (suggested by Frank Neumann).
- Removed checking for minimum line length of 21 characters in the LIRC receiver code
  (reported by Gerald Dachs).
- Updated the Romanian OSD texts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Now storing the original display size when handling DVB subtitles (thanks to
  Reinhard Nissl).
- The original display size of subtitles is now used to scale them properly when
  displaying them on an HD OSD.

2011-04-17: Version 1.7.18

- Changed -O2 to -O3 in Make.config.template (reported by Matti Lehtimäki).
- Added a missing 'default' case in cPixmapMemory::DrawEllipse().
- Fixed some direct comparisons of double values.
- Fixed detecting frames on channels that broadcast with separate "fields" instead
  of complete frames.
- Made updating the editing marks during replay react faster in case the marks
  file has just been written (with a patch from Udo Richter).
- Fixed horizontal scaling of subtitles (reported by Reinhard Nissl).
- Stripped the note "The data returned by this function is only used for informational
  purposes (if any)" from the description of cDevice::GetVideoSize(). The VideoAspect
  is now used to properly scale subtitles.
- Fixed cUnbufferedFile::Seek() in case it is compiled without USE_FADVISE (thanks
  to Juergen Lock).
- Fixed the Language header of the Serbian translation file (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Added anti-aliasing when upscaling bitmaps, which improves the display of SD subtitles
  when replayed on an HD OSD (thanks to Reinhard Nissl for his help in debugging).
- Renamed cBitmap::Scale() to Scaled(), because it doesn't modify the bitmap itself,
  but rather returns a scaled copy.
- Fixed the description of cReceiver in PLUGINS.html, regarding detaching a receiver
  from its device before deleting it (reported by Winfried Köhler). This change in
  behavior was introduced in version 1.5.7.
- Fixed scaling subtitles in case the OSD size is exactly the same as the display
  size of the subtitles.
- Added a missing initialization to sDvbSpuRect (reported by Sergiu Dotenco).
- Replaced "%lld" and "%llX" print format specifiers with "PRId64" and "PRIX64" to
  avoid compiler warnings with gcc 4.5.2 (thanks to Sergiu Dotenco).
  On a personal note: I find it a step in the totally wrong direction that there
  have been macros introduced to work around this problem in the first place. There
  should have been "real" format specifiers defined that address this. These macros
  are nothing but an ugly workaround.
- Added Cancel(3) to ~cTrueColorDemo() in the "osddemo" plugin (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Added a missing font deletion in cTrueColorDemo::Action() in the "osddemo" plugin
  (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed a buffer overflow in cFont::Bidi() (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Added HD stream content identifiers to vdr.5 (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- Made cRecordingInfo::Read(FILE *f) private to avoid calls to it from outside
  cRecordingInfo or cRecording (reported by Mika Laitio).
- The dvbhddevice plugin is now part of the VDR distribution archive (thanks to
  Andreas Regel).
- Removed an obsolete local variable in dvbsdffosd.c (thanks to Paul Menzel).
- Fixed a possible NULL pointer dereference in osddemo.c (reported by Paul Menzel).
- Now using pkg-config to get fribidi, freetype and fontconfig cflags and libs (thanks
  to Ville Skyttä).
- The Makefile now also installs the include files (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Added handling of "ANSI/SCTE 57" descriptors (thanks too Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Avoiding an unecessary call to Recordings.ResetResume() (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl).

2011-06-19: Version 1.7.19

- Fixed cString's operator=(const char *String) in case the given string is the
  same as the existing one (thanks to Dirk Leber).
- Avoiding a gcc 4.6 compiler error in the skincurses plugin (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- TsGetPayload() now checks if there actually is a payload in the given TS packet
  (reported by Dirk Leber).
- Now sorting the source file names in the call to xgettext, to make sure the results
  are not dependent on the sequence of the files.
  Plugin authors may want to change the line containing the xgettext call in their
  Makefile accordingly by changing "$^" to "`ls $^`".
- The primary device is now only avoided for recording if it is an old SD full
  featured card. This is done through the new function cDevice::AvoidRecording().
- Subtitle PIDs are now also decrypted (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Fixed a possible race condition in cDiseqc::Execute() (reported by Marco Göbenich).
  The return value of cDiseqcs::Get() is now const, so plugin authors may need to
  adjust their code if they use this function.
- The new functions cDevice::SignalStrength() and cDevice::SignalQuality() can be
  used to determine the signal strength and quality of a given device (thanks to
  Rolf Ahrenberg for some input on how to use BER and UNC values to generate a
  "quality" value).
- The 'sttng' skin now displays two colored bars at the bottom of the channel display,
  indicating the strength (upper bar) and quality (lower bar) of the received signal.
  The number to the left of these bars indicates the actual device the current
  channel is being received with.
- Fixed detecting frames in case the Picture Start Code or Access Unit Delimiter
  extends over TS packet boundaries (reported by Johan Andersson).
  In order to fix this, the semantics of cFrameDetector had to be changed a little.
  See cRecorder::Action() and cIndexFileGenerator::Action() on how to use the new
  cFrameDetector::NewPayload() function.
- The frame detector now only starts collecting PTS values after it has seen the
  first I-frame, otherwise it might get MaxPtsValues values and stop analyzing
  even though the incoming data is still garbage (reported by Derek Kelly).
- The info file of a recording is now only overwritten with a new fps value if
  that new value is not the default value (thanks to Derek Kelly for reporting a
  problem with the fps value being overwritten in case a recording was interrupted
  and resumed, and the fps value could not be determined after resuming recording).
- The initial channel is now stored by the channel ID in the setup.conf file, in
  order to avoid problems in case channels are reordered or deleted (reported by
  Lars Bläser).
- Added support for "content identifier descriptor" and "default authority descriptor"
  to 'libsi' (thanks to Dave Pickles).

2011-08-15: Version 1.7.20

- Added some missing 'const' to tChannelID (reported by Sundararaj Reel).
- The isnumber() function now checks the given pointer for NULL (thanks to Holger
  Dengler).
- Now checking Setup.InitialChannel for NULL before using it (reported by
  Christoph Haubrich).
- cSkins::Message() now blocks calls from background threads (thanks to Michael
  Eiler for reporting a crash in such a scenario).
- Fixed the return value of the svdrpsend.pl script in case of an error (thanks to
  Jonas Diemer).
- Increased MAXCAIDS to 12 (thanks to Jerome Lacarriere).
- Fixed handling DiSEqC codes (thanks to Mark Hawes for reporting the bug, and
  Udo Richter for suggesting the fix).
- Added a mechanism to defer timer handling in case of problems (reported by
  Frank Niederwipper).
- Fixed distortions that happened when splitting recording into several files
  (was a side effect of "Fixed detecting frames in case the Picture Start Code or
  Access Unit Delimiter extends over TS packet boundaries" in version 1.7.19).
  cRecorder::Action() now buffers TS packets in case the frame type is
  not yet known when a new payload starts. This adds no overhead for channels
  that broadcast the frame type within the first TS packet of a payload; it only
  kicks in if that information is not in the first TS packet.
- Fixed handling the channelID in cMenuEditChanItem (thanks to Udo Richter).
- cStringList::Sort() can now be called with a boolean parameter that controls
  case insensitive sorting (suggested by Sundararaj Reel).
- Now scanning new transponders before old ones, to make sure transponder changes
  are recognized (thanks to Reinhard Nissl).
- Implemented static cIndexFile::IndexFileName().
- The length (as number of frames) of a recording's index file can now be determined
  by a call to cIndexFile::GetLength() (suggested by Christoph Haubrich).
- Fixed some crashes in subtitle display (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Made DELETENULL() thread safe (reported by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The pic2mpg script of the 'pictures' plugin now generates HD images (thanks to
  Andre Weidemann for his support in using convert/ffmpeg). The old SD version is
  still available as pic2mpg-sd.
- Added a mutex to protect cOsd::Osds from simultaneous access from different threads
  (reported by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The cutter now sets the 'broken link' flag for MPEG2 TS recordings (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed language code entry for Portuguese.
- The new command line options --filesize (suggested by Marco Göbenich) and --split
  can be used together with --edit to set the maximum video file size and turn on
  splitting edited files at the editing marks. These options must be given before
  --edit to have an effect.
- cTimeMs is no longer initialized to the current time if the value given to the
  constructor is negative (avoids the "cTimeMs: using monotonic clock..." log message
  before VDR's starting log message).

2011-09-04: Version 1.7.21

- Fixed detecting frames for channels that split frames into several payloads
  (reported by Derek Kelly).
- Now initializing Setup.InitialChannel to an empty string to avoid problems in
  case there is no setup.conf.
- The start time of an edited recording is now set to the time of the first
  editing mark (thanks to Udo Richter).
  This obsoletes the CUTTIME patch.
- Direct access to the members start, priority, lifetime, and deleted of cRecording
  as well as to position and comment of cMark is now deprecated. Plugin authors
  should switch to the new access functions for these members. For now the macro
  __RECORDING_H_DEPRECATED_DIRECT_MEMBER_ACCESS is defined in recording.h, which
  exposes these members, so that existing plugins will still compile. Comment out
  this #define to check whether a particular plugin needs to be modified.
  This #define may be removed in a future version.
- The new functions cRecording::NumFrames() and cRecording::LengthInSeconds() return
  the number of frames and length (in seconds) of a recording (suggested by Steffen
  Barszus).
- The subtitle PIDs are now stored in the channels.conf file as an extension to the
  TPID field (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The new function cDevice::ProvidesEIT() is used to determine whether a device can
  provide EIT data and will thus be used in cEITScanner::Process() to receive EIT
  data from the channels it can receive (suggested by Rolf Ahrenberg). Note that by
  default it is assumed that a device can't provide EIT data, and only the builtin
  cDvbDevice returns true from this function.
- The Audio and Subtitles options are now available through the Green and Yellow
  keys in the Setup/DVB menu (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg). This is mainly for remote
  controls that don't have dedicated keys for these functions.
- The SVDRP command HITK now accepts multiple keys (up to 31).
- The Recordings menu now displays the length (in hours:minutes) of each recording
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg). Note that the "new" indicator has been moved from the
  recording time to the length column. This new format is also used by the SVDRP
  command LSTR, so in case you have an application that parses the LSTR output,
  you will need to adjust it to the new format.
- The dvbsddevice plugin now supports the new option --outputonly, which disables
  receiving on SD FF devices and uses the device only for output (thanks to Udo
  Richter).
- Fixed detecting frames on radio channels (reported by Chris Mayo).
- Revoked the changes to cFrameDetector that have been introduced in version 1.7.19.
  Detecting frames in case the Picture Start Code or Access Unit Delimiter
  extends over TS packet boundaries is now done by locally skipping TS packets
  in cFrameDetector.

2011-12-04: Version 1.7.22

- Fixed scaling subtitles in case the primary device's GetVideoSize() function doesn't
  return actual values (thanks to Luca Olivetti).
- The DiSEqC codes are now copied in the call to cDiseqc::Execute().
- VDR now supports "Satellite Channel Routing" (SCR) according to EN50494 (based on
  the "unicable" patch from Lars Hanisch).
  Since "Unicable" is a registered trademark and stands for only one of many
  implementations of SCR, the following changes have been made compared to the patch,
  which need to be taken into account by people who have set up their system using
  the patch:
  - The 'U' parameter in the diseqc.conf file has been changed to 'S' ("Scr").
  - The configuration file name has been changed from "unicable.conf" to "scr.conf".
- Updated sources.conf (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- The SVDRP command LSTC now also accepts channel IDs (thanks to Dominic Evans).
- Fixed handling DVB subtitles and implemented decoding textual DVB subtitles (thanks
  to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added cap_net_raw to the capabilities that are not dropped (thanks to Dominic Evans).
- Fixed setting the start time of an edited recording (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- Temporarily switching free devices to transponders in order to have their running
  status updated is now done by marking the devices as "occupied" for a certain
  amount of time.
- The new setup options "LNB/Device n connected to sat cable" can be used to define
  which DVB-S devices are connected to the same sat cable and are therefore "bonded".
  This obsoletes the LNBSHARE patch. Users of the LNBSHARE patch will need to newly
  set up their sat devices with the above options.
- Fixed a crash when deleting a recording while cutting it (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed several spelling errors (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- The new SVDRP command UPDR can be used to trigger an update of the list of
  recordings (thanks to Lars Hanisch).
- Added generating a pkg-config file to the Makefile (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Removed the '.pl' suffix from all scripts (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Changed the default location for the LIRC socket to /var/run/lirc/lircd (thanks
  to Ville Skyttä).
- Added file name and line number to LOG_ERROR_STR() (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Replaced all calls to sleep() with cCondWait::SleepMs() (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed a crash with malformed SI data (patch from vdr-portal).

2012-01-15: Version 1.7.23

- Removed the '.pl' suffix from svdrpsend.pl (sorry, I missed that one).
- Fixed bonding more than two devices.
- Fixed handling symbolic links in cRecordings::ScanVideoDir() (reported by
  Sundararaj Reel).
- Fixed a memory leak in cRecordings::ScanVideoDir() in case there are too many
  link levels (reported by Sundararaj Reel).
- Removed redundant memset() in the ctor of cSatCableNumbers (triggered by
  Ville Skyttä pointing out that the argument sequence in the call was wrong).
- Removed a redundant NULL check in cDvbSpuDecoder::setTime() (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Added HasSnr to the DEBUG_SIGNALQUALITY output in cDvbTuner::GetSignalQuality()
  (triggered by Ville Skyttä pointing out that the variable HasSnr was unused).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added support for HbbTV to libsi (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- Added support for devices with more than one delivery system per frontend.
  This requires a DVB driver with version 5.5 or higher that can handle the
  DTV_ENUM_DELSYS call. With older drivers it will fall back to one delivery
  system per frontend.
- Updated the Hungarian language texts (thanks to István Füley).
- cDvbTuner::ExecuteDiseqc() now makes sure only one tuner sends SCR commands
  at any given time (reported by Frank Neumann).
- cEvent::FixEpgBugs() now replaces any newline characters in stream component
  descriptions with blanks (thanks to Torsten Lang for reporting a problem with
  EPG data from BSkyB's "MTV MUSIC", S28.2E-2-2010-7012).
- Fixed cDvbSubtitleConverter::SetOsdData() (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed cListBase::Move() in case From and To are equal (reported by Sundararaj
  Reel).
- Added support for DVB-T2 to libsi (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Added support for handling DVB-T2 transponders.  This requires a DVB driver
  with version 5.3 or higher that can handle the DTV_DVBT2_PLP_ID call (thanks
  to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed cConfig::Load() for g++ version 4.7.0 (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- Fixed a possible memory corruption in cTsToPes::GetPes() in case of broken
  TS packets, e.g. when switching channels.
- Fixed the SVDRP command CLRE for a single channel in case there are events
  that have a timer (thanks to Timo Eskola).
- BIDI support now checks at runtime whether the system runs with UTF-8 (suggested
  by Torsten Lang).
- Added member functions Adapter() and Frontend() to cDvbDevice (suggested by
  Rolf Ahrenberg).
- The parameters that are only used by "second generation" delivery systems (DVB-S2
  and DVB-T2) are no longer written into channels.conf for "first generation"
  delivery systems (DVB-S and DVB-T).
- Changed IndexToHMSF() so that it can handle negative Index values.
- Added option -N to the msgmerge call in the Makefile, because fuzzy translation
  mostly resulted in useless strings.
- The new setup option "Replay/Show remaining time" can be used to switch between
  showing the total length or the remaining time of the recording that is currently
  replayed.
- Fixed wrongfully displaying the length of a recording in the title of the replay
  progress display.
- Fixed frozen live view with device bonding in case the bonded master is used for
  live viewing (reported by Uwe Scheffler).

2012-02-14: Version 1.6.0-3

- Changed cDvbDevice::GrabImage() to use V4L2
  (backport from version 1.7.3, thanks to Ralf Schueler).
- Added some missing 'const' keywords to avoid compilation errors with gcc 4.4
  (backport from version 1.7.8, thanks to Ralf Schueler).
- Modified cSVDRP::CmdGRAB() to avoid writing into const data
  (backport from version 1.7.8, thanks to Ralf Schueler).
- Fixed cRecordings::DelByName() to avoid compilation errors with gcc 4.4
  (backport from version 1.7.9, thanks to Ralf Schueler).

2012-02-19: Version 1.7.24

- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Fixed a high load in case a transponder can't be received.
- Improved the way DVB_API_VERSION is checked.
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed asserting there is a live programme if the primary device is bonded with
  a device that starts a recording on a different band.
- Fixed the return type of cMyDeviceHook::DeviceProvidesTransponder() in PLUGINS.html.
- Fixed a crash in a plugin using cDeviceHook when VDR ends (reported by Oliver Endriss).
- Some improvements to the Makefiles (thanks to Christian Ruppert).
- Fixed cRecording::LengthInSeconds(), which wrongfully rounded the result to full
  minutes (thanks to Christoph Haubrich).
- Symbolic links are no longer resolved in cRecordings::ScanVideoDir() (thanks to
  Sundararaj Reel).
- The epg.data file is now read in a separate thread to make the startup process
  faster in case the file is very large (suggested by Helmut Auer).
- Fixed selecting the primary device for receiving the live viewing channel in
  case it is bonded with an other device and has no receiver attached to it.
- Fixed a possible crash when canceling VDR while displaying subtitles, and the
  primary device is no longer available.
- Improved handling subtitles of BBC channels.
- No longer using tabs as delimiter in the EPG bugfix log (they were garbled in the
  log file).
- Added a missing '.' after the month in VPS strings.
- Added some missing 'const' to cDevice (thanks to Joachim Wilke).
- Fixed handling the PrimaryLimit when requesting a device for live viewing
  (reported by Uwe Scheffler).
- Removed superfluous calls to SetVideoFormat() from device constructors. This
  function is called in cDevice::SetPrimaryDevice(), anyway.
- An ongoing editing process is now canceled if either the original or the edited
  version of the recording is deleted from the Recordings menu.
- The SVDRP command DELR now won't delete a recording that is currently being edited.
- Removed code stub for obsolete SVDRP command MOVT.
- The DVB device adapters/frontends are now probed by scanning the /dev/dvb directory
  instead of looping through adapter/frontend numbers. This allows for "holes" in the
  device numbering.
- cReadDir::Next() now skips directory entries "." and "..".
- Fixed a possible deadlock in time shift mode.
- Fixed switching into time shift mode when pausing live video (thanks to Reinhard
  Nissl for helping to debug this one).

2012-03-03: Version 1.7.25

- The fps value for channels where it differs from the default is now set correctly
  when pausing live video.
- Increased the average character estimate for calculating tab positions in skins,
  to better suit wide fonts (reported by Rudi Hofer).
- Fixed getting the subsystem ids of DVB devices in case they have been rearranged
  via udev rules.
- Added several cTimer::Set...() functions (suggested by Alexander Rieger).
- Changed the return value of cTimer::SetFile() to 'void'.
- Revoked "Fixed a possible deadlock in time shift mode" because it caused trouble with
  output on vdr-xine and dxr3, and also short glitches when replaying on any output
  device.
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling subtitle color palettes on channels where subtitles appear
  "word by word" (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed upscaling cBitmaps with anti-aliasing (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for reporting
  a problem with color palettes in subtitles).
- Fixed getting the video aspect ratio for scaling subtitles.
- Removed the "PrimaryLimit". Old "full featured" DVB cards can be run with the
  --outputonly option to avoid problems with recording high bandwidth channels.
  Besides, with HDTV becoming ever more popular those cards are pretty much obsolete
  by now (the TT S2-6400 has no problems recording and replaying high bandwidth
  channels simultaneously). And, last but not least, people using software players
  won't notice this change, anyway.
- Since cReceivers can have priorities between -99 and 99, the priority
  for an unused device has been changed from -1 to -100.
- If the first event in a schedule has a table id of 0x00, any incoming EIT data for
  that schedule from the DVB stream will be completely ignored. This way an external
  EPG source can fill the schedules with EPG data that will not be messed up with
  that from the DVB data stream. Note, though, that this means VDR can not do VPS
  controlled recordings with such events!
- Added some typecasts to silence gcc compiler warnings (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed handling overlapping timers in case a VPS timer with higher priority needs
  to interrupt a timer with lower priority.
- The code for the RCU remote control unit has been moved into a separate plugin
  named "rcu".
  The REMOTE=RCU option in the 'make' call for VDR is now obsolete.
  The command line option --rcu is now obsolete. Use -Prcu instead. If you have
  used --rcu with a device path, use -P"rcu -d<device>".
- Added support for automatically selecting subtitles when playing old PES
  recordings made with the subtitles plugin (thanks to Anssi Hannula).
- Revised priority handling to allow receivers with a priority that is lower than
  that of live viewing (with suggestions from Frank Schmirler):
  + An idle device (one that is not used for live viewing and has no receiver
    attached to it) now has priority IDLEPRIORITY (-100).
  + An unused CAM slot now has priority IDLEPRIORITY.
  + The default priority of a cReceiver is now MINPRIORITY (-99).
  + A device that is used only for live viewing (no matter whether it's in Transfer
    Mode or real live mode) now has priority TRANSFERPRIORITY (-1).
  + The function cDevice::Receiving() now returns true if there is any receiver
    attached to the device. Its boolean parameter has no meaning any more.
  + The default value for the Priority parameter of the function cDevice::ProvidesChannel()
    has been changed to IDLEPRIORITY.
- Added a Query parameter to cDevice::GetDevice(), so that devices can be queried
  without side effects when zapping.
- Replaced min(max()) calls with the new function constrain().
- Fixed handling OSD color button texts in case a menu item has texts of its own
  (reported by Rolf Ahrenberg). If a plugin creates derived cMenuEditItems that set
  color button texts, these should not set the texts directly by calling
  cSkinDisplay::Current()->SetButtons(), but rather call the new member function
  cMenuEditItem::SetHelp().
- Moved the call to cStatus::MsgChannelSwitch(this, 0) to the beginning of
  cDevice::SetChannel(), so that any receivers that have been attached to the
  device by plugins may be detached before the final call to GetDevice().
  This actually reverts "Only calling cStatus::MsgChannelSwitch() if a channel
  is actually going to be switched or has actually been switched successfully"
  which was made in version 1.1.10, so please report if this has any unwanted
  side effects.

2012-03-10: Version 1.7.26

- Now checking for NULL in cOsd::AddPixmap() (suggested by Christoph Haubrich).
- Fixed the German translation of "VDR will shut down in %s minutes" (thanks to
  Frank Neumann).
- The replay progress display is now turned on whenever a mark is toggled (not
  only when one is set).
- Toggling a mark now restarts the timeout of the replay progress display.
- Fixed a possible race condition with the SVDRP commands CLRE and PUTE, where
  EPG data from the transponder could be handled even though it shouldn't be
  handled for 10 seconds.
- Added some missing member initializations in cBitmap.
- Improved displaying the play mode in the ST:TNG skin.
- Made the ST:TNG skin the default in case the user selected skin is not available.
- Improved displaying signal strength and quality in the ST:TNG skin's channel
  display.
- Fixed switching devices to the transponders of VPS recordings in case there
  are only bonded devices. The cDevice's "avoid device" mechanism has been replaced
  by using "occupied".
- Fixed selecting devices for the EPG scan in case the primary device is bonded
  with an other one.
- Removed the calls to EITScanner.UsesDevice(this) from dvb[hs]ddevice.c, because
  the code following these calls is only executed if LiveView is true, which is
  never the case when the EITScanner switches to a channel.
- Removed the obsolete function cEITScanner::UsesDevice(). If a plugin has used this
  function to find out whether a call to its cStatus::ChannelSwitch() function was
  due to a live channel switch, it can use that function's new parameter LiveView.
  Any plugins that implement cStatus::ChannelSwitch() need to add the parameter
  'bool LiveView' to that function.
- Fixed parsing channel data in case the audio pid is 0. On channels that only
  broadcast Dolby Digital audio there were sometimes log entries like
  "changing pids of channel ... from ... to ..." with no apparent difference
  between the old and new set of pids.
- Fixed checking pids in case a channel has only Dolby Digital audio.
- The Green button in the "Edit timer" menu can now be used to toggle between single
  shot and repeating timers. This is the same as pressing '0' when the "Day" field
  is selected, but it works at any time (and is more obvious).
- Revoked "If the first event in a schedule has a table id of 0x00, any incoming EIT data for
  that schedule from the DVB stream will be completely ignored".
- Added a new plugin interface for implementing EPG handlers.
  + A plugin can implement an EPG handler by creating an object derived from
    cEpgHandler and implementing the necessary member functions.
  + The special handling of events with table id 0x00 has been dropped.
    For backwards compatibility EPG events with table ids lower than 0x4E will
    be treated as if they had a table id of 0x4E, and the new plugin 'epgtableid0'
    can be used to have them handled like in previous versions.
  + The default table id for a newly created cEvent has been changed to 0xFF,
    which is higher than any normal table id that is broadcast in the EIT data.
  See PLUGINS.html, section "Electronic Program Guide" for more information.

2012-03-25: Version 1.7.27

- Updated the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Changed the Green button in the "Edit timer" menu from "Once" to "Single"
  (suggested by Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed some typos in HISTORY and CONTRIBUTORS (thanks to Ville Skyttä).
- The channel name column in the "What's on now/next" menu now adjusts its width
  to display the full short name of each channel (suggested by Dominic Evans).
- Dropped the meanwhile obsolete script 'i18n-to-gettext'.
- Removed the obsolete function cPlugin::RegisterI18n().
- Removed the obsolete typedef tI18nPhrase.
- Adapted menu column widths of 'skincurses' to the wider HD OSD sizes.
- Deactivated definition of __RECORDING_H_DEPRECATED_DIRECT_MEMBER_ACCESS (recording.h)
  and LEGACY_CRECEIVER (receiver.h) to trigger an error for any plugin that still
  uses the respective code. You can reactivate these to quickly make your plugin
  compile again, but beware that these code parts will be removed in one of the next
  versions.
- Made the "overloaded-virtual" warning an error to detect hidden overloaded
  virtual functions (thanks to Anssi Hannula for pointing out -Werror=...).
  Plugin authors may want to change -Woverloaded-virtual to -Werror=overloaded-virtual
  in their Makefiles.
- Updated the Estonian OSD texts (thanks to Arthur Konovalov).
- Improved fast forwarding to the end of a timeshift recording.
- The new function cDevice::DeviceName() returns a string identifying the name of
  the given device.
- When toggling a timer between "Single" and "Repeating", the previous setting is now
  retained in case the user toggles back to the original value.
- When estimating the remaining disk space (in hours), the average data rate of all
  existing recordings is now taken into account. If this value can't be determined,
  the previous value of 25.75 MB/min is taken.
- No longer using GetFont() (which is not thread safe) in the 'osddemo' plugin.
- No longer using GetFont() (which is not thread safe) in cSubtitleRegion::UpdateTextData().
- Fixed a memory leak in cSubtitleRegion::UpdateTextData().
- Moved setting LC_NUMERIC further up to make sure any floating point numbers use a
  decimal point (suggested by Tobias Grimm).
- Added missing channel locking to cEIT.
- Fixed reduced bpp support for DVB subtitles (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Updated the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Diego Pierotto).
- Reverted some improvements to Make.config.template (thanks to Christian Ruppert).
- Fixed handling IDLEPRIORITY in cDvbDevice::ProvidesChannel() (thanks to Frank
  Schmirler).
