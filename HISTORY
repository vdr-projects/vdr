Video Disk Recorder Revision History
------------------------------------

2000-02-19: Version 0.01 (Initial revision).

2000-03-11: Version 0.02

- Fixed compilation with only DEBUG_REMOTE=1.
- Menus now use colors.
- Support for "Red", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue" buttons.
- Channels and Timers can now be added, deleted and moved.
- Basic record/play file handling support (no actual record/playback yet).

2000-04-15: Version 0.03

- Actual record/replay now works.
- Dropped the idea of different "recording qualities" (a 36GB harddisk is
  able to store some 18 hours in full quality, so we don't really need that).
- Termination signals are now caught and the program cleans up before exiting.
- Support for CICAM.
