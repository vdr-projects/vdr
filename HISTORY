Video Disk Recorder Revision History
------------------------------------

2000-02-19: Version 0.01

- Initial revision.

2000-03-11: Version 0.02

- Fixed compilation with only DEBUG_REMOTE=1.
- Menus now use colors.
- Support for "Red", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue" buttons.
- Channels and Timers can now be added, deleted and moved.
- Basic record/play file handling support (no actual record/playback yet).

2000-04-15: Version 0.03

- Actual record/replay now works.
- Dropped the idea of different "recording qualities" (a 36GB harddisk is
  able to store some 18 hours in full quality, so we don't really need that).
- Termination signals are now caught and the program cleans up before exiting.
- Support for CICAM.

2000-04-24: Version 0.04

- Changed name from 'osm' to 'vdr' to avoid mixups with the 'oms' program that
  appears to be in use with DVD replay.
- Implemented a channel display in the top menu line.
- Implemented replay progress display (press "Ok" when replaying to bring it up).
- Implemented direct channel selecting by pressing the numeric keys.
- Added several 'const' keywords to please stricter compilers.
- The repeat function for the remote control no longer adapts dynamically
  to the timing of the RCU (this sometimes caused the repeat function to
  kick in too early).
- Channel selection is now blocked when recording or replaying.
- Improved process handling.

2000-05-27: Version 0.05

- Support for more than one DVB card.
- Simultaneous record and replay (with two DVB cards).
- Instant recordings no longer get the name "instant". They now get the name
  of the channel, with a prepended '@' character.
- Timers that are not given an explicit Name now use the channel name with
  a prepended '@' character.
- If an instant recording is currently active, the "Main" menu now contains
  an option to stop that recording.
- Timers are now only processed when the Menu is not active. So after editing
  a timer the effect will take place only after the menu has been closed.
  In order to avoid missing a timer event by inadvertently leaving the menu
  open, the menu will be closed automatically after about two minutes of
  inactivity.
- If a recording is currently being replayed, the "Main" menu now contains an
  option to stop replaying.
- Displaying the recording DVB interface status in the decimal points of the
  RCU display.
- Reduced the number of remote control keys. Modified the key assignments for
  the PC keyboard to better resemble the "up-down-left-right-ok" layout on
  menu controlling remote control units.

2000-07-25: Version 0.6

- Added support for LIRC remote control (thanks to Carsten Koch!).
  There are now three different remote control modes: KBD (PC-Keyboard), RCU
  and LIRC. See the INSTALL file for information on how to enable either of
  these modes. The default mode is now KBD, not RCU as before (to make it
  work immediately even if there is no actual remote control).
- Fixed small bug in dvbapi.c that was causing some channels (many on hotbird)
  not to be correctly tuned (thanks to Plamen Ganev!).
- Now clearing the replay buffer in search forward/back, which results in
  faster reaction.
- The 'Recordings' menu is now listed alphabetically (thanks to Carsten Koch!).
- The new 'epg2timers' tool (thanks to Carsten Koch!) can be used to convert
  an EPG "merkliste" page (http://www.tvtv.de) to vdr timer entries.
- The new 'xtvrc2vdr' tool (thanks to Plamen Ganev!) can be used to convert
  'xtvrc' channel files into 'vdr' format.
- When more than one timer matches at the same time, the first one in the list
  with the highest 'Priority' is selected.
- The MANUAL section on "Programming the Timer" has been filled in.
- The year in the "Recordings" menu as well as in the progress display during
  replay has been reduced to 2 digits to allow more space for the recording's
  title. In the internal file structure the year is still stored with 4 digits,
  so there will be no problem at the next turn of the century ;-)
- Channel names and timer filenames can now contain blanks. To avoid problems
  with file names that contain blanks, all blanks in recording file names are
  converted to underscores.
- The polarization can now be given in uppercase or lowercase characters in
  'channels.conf'.
- Fixed buffer initialization to work with DVB driver version 0.6.
- Implemented the "Simple Video Disk Recorder Protocol" (SVDRP) to control
  the VDR over a network connection.
- Implemented command line option handling.
- The program can now run in full background mode by using the --daemon option.
- Added a "summary" field to the timers (thanks to Carsten Koch!).
  This field can contain a descriptive text of the programme and will be
  displayed when the "Blue" button is pressed on a recording that was created by
  this timer. If the text contains the special character '|', a newline will
  be inserted at that place.  When pressing "Ok" on a timer that contains a
  summary field, the summary will be displayed. To edit such a timer the "Red"
  key must be pressed. Timers without a summary still go into Edit mode when
  pressing "Ok".  The summary field can only be filled in directly by editing
  the 'timers.conf' file with a text editor, or by defining/modifying the timer
  via the SVDRP interface.

2000-08-06: Version 0.61

- When scrolling through a list it now moves a full page up or down when the
  cursor reaches the top or bottom of the menu (thanks to Heino Goldenstein!).
- Added missing '#include <sys/stat.h>' to recording.c.
- The video directory can now be defined with the command line option -v.
- There can now be more than one video directory (in case you have several
  disks).
- Fixed learning key codes for PC keyboard.
- New command line option '-l' to set the log level.
- Times in timers.conf are now always printed with 4 digits (leading '0').
- Slow forward/back mode (thanks to Guido Fiala!).
- The "Up" key in replay mode no longer restarts replay at the very beginning,
  but rather resumes normal replay mode after a "pause", "forward" or "backward"
  operation. Use the "Skip -60s" function repeatedly to go back to the beginning
  of the recording.
- Improved reaction on user input in fast/slow forward/back modes.
- No more upper limit for the value of 'Pnr'.
- Checking if the video card is really a DVB card.
- New SVDRP command UPDT to update an existing timer (or add a new one if it
  doesn't yet exist).
- New version of the 'epg2timers' tool (with a modified channel list).
- Bugfix in closing window in DEBUG_OSD mode.

2000-09-03: Version 0.62

- The Makefile now defines DVBDIR to easily point to where the DVB driver
  source is located.
- When switching channels the current/next information is now displayed if
  available (thanks to Robert Schneider). Since there is now more information
  to read when switching channels, the timeout for displaying it has been
  increased from 2 to 5 seconds (remember that this info can always be recalled
  by pressing the "Ok" button).
  For this feature to work it is necessary that the 'Pnr' parameter in the
  channel setup ('channels.conf') is set to the proper value. This has been
  done for some of the channels in the default 'channels.conf'. Some other
  parameters in the default 'channels.conf' have also been updated, so please
  make sure your timers still use the correct channels!

2000-09-10: Version 0.63

- The new "Setup" menu allows the user to configure several parameters to his/her
  personal taste (see MANUAL for details).
- Workaround for a driver timing problem in cDvbApi::Cmd(), which sometimes caused
  the OSD to no longer be displayed (thanks to Niels de Carpentier).
- Added the '-m486' option to the compiler call.
- If a channel name contains a colon (':') it is now replaced with a '|' in
  'channels.conf'.
- Not everybody appears to like the "page scrolling" mechanism introduced by
  Heino Goldenstein in version 0.61, so this is now configurable via the "Setup"
  menu.
- The new 'dvbrc2vdr' tool (thanks to Plamen Ganev!) can be used to convert
  'dvbrc' channel files into 'vdr' format.
- Channels can now be "grouped" (thanks to Plamen Ganev!). See MANUAL for details.
  There is currently no mechanism to define and maintain "Channel groups" via
  the menu, so you'll have to insert "Channel group" control lines into your
  'channels.conf' file manually (for example with a text editor).
- Started a new file named FORMATS with a description of the various file
  formats used by VDR.
- The "Primary DVB interface" can now be chosen via the "Setup" menu.
- Display of the "current/next" information when switching channels can now
  be disabled via the "Setup" menu.
- The "current/next" display now only shows those lines that actually contain
  information.
- When directly selecting a channel by entering the channel number, the digits
  entered so far together with the name of that channel are displayed on the
  OSD (suggested by Martin Hammerschmid).

2000-09-20: Version 0.64

- NOTE: If you are using DVB driver version 0.7 you need to load the dvb.o
  module with option outstream=0, so your insmod statement should read
  'insmod dvb.o outstream=0'. This is currently necessary because 'vdr'
  still works with AV_PES data.
- Video files now have the 'group read' bit set.
- Fixed handling errors in 'readstring()'.
- Handling SIGPIPE and re-establishing handler after intercepting a signal.
- The configuration files are now by default read from the video directory.
  This can be changed by using the new '-c' option. Make sure you copy your
  current '*.conf' files to your video directory ('/video' by default), or
  use "-c ." to get the old behaviour of loading the configuration files
  from the current directory.
- Waiting for input is now handled by a common function, which improves
  response time on user actions. As a consequence the EIT data may sometimes
  not be displayed, but this will change later when cEIT runs as a separate
  thread.
- The new SVDRP command 'HITK' (thanks to Guido Fiala!) can be used to 'hit'
  a remote control key.  Establish an SVDRP connection and enter HITK without
  a parameter for a list of all valid key names.
- The new SVDRP command 'GRAB' (thanks to Guido Fiala!) can be used to grab
  the current frame and save it to a file.
- The new SVDRP commands 'OVL*' can be used to control video overlays (thanks
  to Guido Fiala!). This is mainly for use in the 'kvdr' tool (see the 'kvdr'
  page at http://www.s.netic.de/gfiala).
- If the name of the video directory used with the '-v' option had trailing
  slashes, the recording file names have been damaged. Trailing slashes are
  now silently removed.
- Fixed a buffer overflow in EIT parsing.
- Added a security warning regarding SVDRP to the INSTALL file.
- Fixed 'confirm' dialog.
- The daemon mode (option '-d') now no longer works with REMOTE=KBD (there
  is no stdin in daemon mode, so KBD makes no sense - plus it sometimes
  crashed).

2000-10-03: Version 0.65

- Modified LIRC interface to better handle repeat function.
- Faster OSD by first writing into a bitmap and then sending the entire bitmap
  to the DVB driver at once (requires the patch 'dvb.c.071.diff' to be applied
  against the version 0.71 DVB driver file 'dvb.c').
- When switching channels the channel is now immediately displayed, and the
  current/next information is shown as soon as it becomes available.
- No longer displaying the year in the 'Recordings' menu to save space for the
  title.
- The 'Recordings' menu now displays a '*' to indicate new recordings.
- Added the description of the timers.conf file to the FORMATS file (thanks to
  Bastian Guse).
- Displaying as much as possible of the current/next info (dropping characters
  that would display only partially).
- In normal viewing mode the '0' key now toggles between the current and the
  previous channel.

2000-10-08: Version 0.66

- Remote control data is now received in a separate thread, which makes things
  a lot smoother.
- Repeat and release of remote control keys is now explicitly distinguished.
- In replay mode the search forward/back and skip functions now have two modes:
  Pressing the key shortly and releasing it starts the function, and pressing it
  again stops it. Pressing and holding down the key starts the function and
  releasing the key stops it.
- The '@' character that marks an "instant recording" can now be turned off
  in the "Setup" menu (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- Pressing the "Back" button while replaying now stops replaying and brings up
  the "Recordings" menu (suggested by Carsten Koch). This can be used to easily
  delete a recording after watching it, or to switch to a different recording.
- The "Recordings" menu now places the cursor on the last replayed recording, if
  that file still exists.
- The "Blue" button in the "Main" menu can now be used to "Resume" a previously
  stopped replay session (suggested by Martin Hammerschmid).
- The low and high LNB frequencies can now be changed in the "Setup" menu.

2000-11-01: Version 0.67

- The EIT information is now gathered in a separate thread.
- The sytem time can now be synchronized to the time broadcast in the DVB data
  stream. This can be enabled in the "Setup" menu by setting "SetSystemTime" to
  1.  Note that this works only if VDR is running under a user ID that has
  permisson to set the system time.
- The new item "Schedule" in the "Main" menu opens VDR's EPG (thanks to Robert
  Schneider). See the MANUAL file for a detailed description.
- The new setup parameters MarginStart and MarginStop define how long (in
  minutes) before the official start time of a broadcast VDR shall begin
  recording, and how long after the official end time it shall stop recording.
  These are used when a recording is programmed from the "Schedules" menu.
- The delay value in the dvb.c.071.diff patch to the driver has been increased
  to '3', because on some systems the OSD was not displayed correctly. If you
  are running an already patched version 0.71 driver and encounter problems
  with the OSD, please make sure the parameter in the ddelay call is '3', not
  '2'.
- Fixed initializing the RCU remote control code (didn't work after switching
  on the system).
- Problematic characters in recording names (which can come from timers that
  are programmed via the "Schedules" menu) are now replaced by suitable
  substitutes.

2000-11-19: Version 0.68

- Date and time in the title of an event info page are now always right adjusted.
- The 'current channel' is now handled device specific (in case there is more
  than one DVB card).
- The 'SetSystemTime' option in the "Setup" menu is now shown as "yes/no".
- Implemented "internationalization" (see 'i18n.c' for information on how to
  add new languages). Thanks to Miha Setina for translating the OSD texts to
  the Slovenian language.
- Fixed learning keys on the PC keyboard (display oscillated).
- Fixed a timing problem with OSD refresh and SVDRP.
- Avoiding multiple definitions of the same timer in the "Schedule" menu (this
  could happen when pressing the "Red" button while editing the timer).
- There can now be a configuration file named 'commands.conf' that defines
  commands that can be executed through the "Main" menu's "Commands" option
  (see FORMATS for details on how to define these commands).
- Added a 'fixed' font for use with the output of system commands.
- The 'Priority' parameter of the timers is now also used to interrupt a low
  priority timer recording if a higher priority timer wants to record.
- A timer recording on a DVB card with a CAM module will now be interrupted
  by a timer that needs to use this specific DVB card to record an encrypted
  channel, if the timer currently occupying this DVB card doesn't need the
  CAM module (and thus can continue recording on a different DVB card).
- The "Yellow" button in the "What's on now/next?" menus now displays the
  schedule of the current channel from that menu.
- All DVB cards in a multi-card system now write their EIT information into the
  same data structure.
- If there is more than one DVB card in the system, the non-primary cards are
  now used to periodically scan through the channels in order to keep the
  EPG info up-to-date. Scanning kicks in after 60 seconds of user inactivity
  (timeout in order to keep user interactions instantaneously) and each channel
  that has the 'pnr' parameter defined in 'channels.conf' is switched to for
  20 seconds. If there is only one DVB card in the system, that card will start
  scanning after 5 hours (configurable through the "Setup" menu) of user inactivity
  and will switch back to the channel it originally displayed at the first sign of
  user activity. Any scanning will only occur if that particular card is not
  currently recording or replaying.
- Now shifting the 'Subtitle' info into the 'ExtendedDescription' on stations
  that don't send the EIT information correctly (like, e.g., 'VOX').
- Implemented a 10 seconds latency when removing files.
- Fixed unwanted reaction on the "Green" and "Yellow" button in the "Event" display.
- Implemented 'Transfer Mode' to display video data from the DVB card that actually
  can receive a certain channel on the primary interface. This is currently in
  an early state and may still cause some problems, but it appears to work nice
  already.

2001-01-18: Version 0.70

- VDR now requires driver version 0.8.1 or higher.
- Recordings are now saved in PES mode. Note that you now need to install the
  driver *WITHOUT* 'outstream=0'! This is the default when you 'make insmod' in
  the DVB/driver directory.
  Old recordings (in AV_PES mode) can still be replayed (as long as the driver
  still supports replaying AV_PES files). The only limitation with this is that
  in fast forward/back mode the picture may be slightly distorted and there may
  be sound fragments.
- The EPG data is now dumped into the file /video/epg.data every ten minutes.
  Use the Perl script 'epg2html.pl' to convert the raw EPG data into a simple
  HTML programme listing.
- Fixed handling of channel switching with the "Blue" button in the "What's on
  now/next?" menus.
- Fixed saving the MarginStop setup parameter.
- Fixed missing initialization in cConfig.
- Implemented "On Disk Editing".
- There is no more default 'timers.conf' file.
- Added Italian language texts (thanks to Alberto Carraro).
- Fixed starting a replay session when the program is currently in 'Transfer
  Mode'.
- Fixed setting/modifying timers via SVDRP with empty summary fields.
- Fixed a problem with recordings that have a single quote character in their
  name (this is now mapped to 0x01).
- Changed the value for Diseqc to '0' in the default 'channels.conf'.
- Fixed displaying channels and recording status in the RCU's LED display when
  a recording is interrupted due to higher priority.
- Implemented safe writing of config files (first writes into a temporary file
  and then renames it).
- In case the video data stream is broken the log message will come only every
  5 seconds.
- The current channel is now saved in the 'setup.conf' file when VDR is cancelled,
  and will be restored next time it is started (thanks to Deti Fliegl).
- The EIT scanning thread is now locked when switching channels to avoid problems.
- Encrypted channels can now be selected even without knowing the PNR (however, it
  is still necessary for the EPG info).

2001-02-24: Version 0.71

- Fixed 'Transfer Mode' in cases where a non-primary interface was switched to
  a channel that only the primary interface can receive (which could happen in
  the EPG scanner).
- The EPG scanner now starts with the first channel (it used to start with the
  second channel).
- Reacitvated setting the PNR.
- Adapted the frame scanning to the new muxing of the driver.
- The new compile time option REMOTE=NONE can be used to compile VDR without
  any remote control support (for applications where it shall be controlled
  exclusively via SVDRP).
- The new command line option -D can be used to define which DVB interfaces
  a certain instance of VDR shall use.
- The "Left" and "Right" keys are now used to page up and down in lists (thanks
  to Martin Hammerschmid). Since the "Timers" menu already uses these keys to
  (de)activate timers, this functionality is not available there.
- The "Main" and "Commands" menu now support "hotkeys", which means that if the
  first non-blank character of a menu item is a digit in the range 1..9, that
  item can be selected by pressing the respective numeric key on the remote
  control.
- The channel data in 'channels.conf' now contains the teletext PID (thanks to
  Dave Chapman). Existing files will be read normally (and the teletext PID set
  to 0), but once they are written back (due to some channel editing) the file
  will have the new format.
- The EPG scanner now scans each transponder only once per cycle.
- Deleted recordings are now automatically removed from disk after a while (not
  only when disk space is being needed for a new recording).
- Fixed repeat function in LIRC remote control.
- Changed the MAXDVBAPI macro in dvbapi.c to 4 in order to directly support the
  maximum possible number of DVB cards.
- The 'Ca' parameter in the default 'channels.conf' has been changed from '2'
  to '3' because the VDR prototype now has 3 DVB cards (and currently the CAM
  module only works if it is inserted into the last DVB card).
- The "Now", "Next" and "Schedule" menus now remember the current channel and
  restore the list when switching between them.
- The "Green" button in the "Recordings" menu can now be used to rewind a
  recording and play it from the very beginning.
- Fixed handling ':' in timer filenames and '\n' in timer summaries (see FORMATS).
- When removing recordings empty directories are now removed from the video
  directory.
- Added the "schnitt" tools from Matthias Schniedermeyer.
- New SVDRP command MESG to display a short message on the OSD.
- The Perl script 'svdrpsend.pl' can be used to send SVDRP commands to VDR.
- SVDRP can now immediately reuse the same port if VDR is restarted.
- SVDRP now has a timeout after which the connection is automatically closed
  (default is 300 seconds, can be changed in "Setup").
- The compile time switch VFAT can be used to make VDR avoid the ':' character
  in file names (VFAT can't handle them). Do 'make VFAT=1' to enable this.
- Support for DVB-C (thanks to Hans-Peter Raschke and Peter Hofmann).
  See the INSTALL file for more information about the use of VDR with cable.
- Fixed an occasional segfault in the EIT processor.
- A value of '0' for the EPGScanTimeout setup parameter now completely turns off
  scanning for EPG data on both single and multiple card systems.
- New setup parameter "PrimaryLimit" that allows to prevent timers from using the
  primary DVB interface in multi card systems. Default value is 0, which means
  that every timer may use the primary interface.
- The 'active' field of a timer will now be explicitly set to '1' if the user
  modifies an active timer (see FORMATS for details).
- The new command line option -w can be used to activate a watchdog that makes
  VDR exit in case the main program loop does not respond for more than the
  given number of seconds. This is mainly useful in combination with the new
  'runvdr' script that restarts VDR in case is has exited.

2001-04-01: Version 0.72

- Fixed SVDRP commands LSTC and LSTT to make them return an error message if
  no channels or timers are defined.
- Enhanced 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Hans-Peter Raschke).
- Fixed switching to another channel via the EPG while a recording is being
  replayed.
- Fixed a memory leak in the EIT processor that happened when the system time
  was set.
- Removed some redundant code from the cListBase destructor.
- Fixed internationalization of some "Main" menu texts.
- Updated 'channels.conf' after the recent changes of Premiere World (thanks
  to Axel Gruber).
- Redesigned the ring buffer to make it work with two separate threads for
  input and output (also prepared for using a remultiplexer).
- Fixed setting system time from transponders.
- Fixed a segfault in the Schedule menu in case there is no EPG information.
- The 'runvdr' script now kills any leftover vdr threads before restarting it.
- Fixed a problem with Daylight Saving Time when displaying the times of
  recordings.
- Added Dutch language texts (thanks to Arnold Niessen).
- The new command line option -t can be used to set the controlling terminal
  (thanks to Jürgen Sauer). This is especially useful when starting VDR through
  an entry in /etc/inittab (see INSTALL).
- Since the CAM module only works if it is installed in the "highest" DVB card,
  recordings now search for a free DVB card from lowest to highest index (as
  opposed to the previous "highest to lowest" search) in order to not use the
  CAM card for FTA recordings unless necessary. This is only important for
  systems with three or more DVB cards.
- Added the "statdvb2vdr" tool from Hans-Peter Raschke.
- Fixed a segfault that sometimes happened when killing VDR.
- VDR now returns an exit status of '2' in case of an error at startup, instead
  of terminating with 'abort()' (which caused a core dump).
- SVDRP now also works with clients that don't do line buffering (like the
  Windows 'telnet').
- Empty lines in config files no longer cause error messages.
- New SVDRP command LSTE to list the EPG data.
- The SVDRP HELP command now prints the topics in several columns.

2001-06-02: Version 0.80

- VDR now requires driver version 0.9.0 or higher.
- Switched to the "new API" (thanks to Dave Chapman for his great support in
  this task).
- New setup parameter "LnbSLOF" that defines the switching frequency of the LNB.
- Fixed a bug in the EPG scanner with more than one DVB card.
- Fixed checking for free disk space, so that it works with NFS mounted drives.
- Files are now created with mode 644.
- Fixed checking the exit status in the 'runvdr' script.
- Activated loading the driver in 'runvdr'. Please read the comments in 'runvdr'
  for details.
- The new "emergency exit" feature automatically triggers a restart of VDR (if
  used with 'runvdr', otherwise it simply exists) if
  * tuning the channel for a recording fails
  * no useful data is received within the first 1MB of a recording
  * no data is received within a recording for more than 5 seconds
  This should make sure that a recording is successfully restarted after any
  problems.
- Processing the EIT data is now disabled during replay and 'Transfer Mode' in
  order to avoid video and audio glitches (there appears to be a bandwidth
  problem somewhere in the driver/firmware/hardware).
- Due to the reduced amount of OSD memory provided by the driver the number of
  lines in the OSD had to be reduced by 2. By rearranging some of the display
  items the amount of visible information remained the same as before, though.
  If your DVB card has even less memory (which would result in only the
  channel switching display and the replay progress display being visible, but
  no "Main" menu), try reducing the constant 'MenuLines' in dvbapi.h (currently
  '13') even further.
- There are two new setup parameters to define the "Default Priority" and
  "Default Lifetime" when creating a new timer event.
- The meaning of the "Lifetime" parameter has been modified: a value of '99'
  now means that the recording will live "forever", and a value of '0' means
  that the recording has no guaranteed lifetime and will be deleted whenever
  a new recording with higher priority needs disk space.
- Updated version of Matthias Schniedermeyer's 'schnitt' tools.
- New 'master-timer' tool (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer).

2001-06-12: Version 0.81

- Fixed handling the case where the driver reports EAGAIN during recording,
  but no data comes within 5 seconds.
- Fixed EPG scanning on single DVB card systems.
- There can now be two audio PIDs per channel, which can be toggled via the
  "Green" button in the "Main" menu. The "Edit Channel" menu therefore now
  has two audio PID fields (Apid1 and Apid2). By default, Apid2 is 0, which
  means there is no alternate audio track.
- Fixed replaying in case the driver reports EAGAIN.
- Now 'runvdr' checks if the driver is already loaded (thanks to Henning
  Holtschneider).
- Fixed removing recordings with Lifetime = 99.
- Improved channel switching.

2001-06-16: Version 0.82

- Increased timeout until reporting "broken video data stream" when recording.
- Increased amount of non-useful data received by cRemux before assuming the
  recording will fail.
- If there are two audio PIDs defined for a channel, both audio tracks will
  now be recorded and can be selectively replayed later. See the FORMATS file
  for details on how these different audio tracks are stored in the recorded
  files. In order for this to work properly you need to use a driver version
  dated 2001-06-16 or later, where the default PES filter buffer size has been
  reduced. This will create packets for the second audio track that are small
  enough to multiplex smoothly with the video data.
- Fixed a bug in the editing mechanism (didn't work with recordings that
  consist of more than one data file).
- The compile time switch VFAT has been fixed to recognize the ':' character
  in recording names, too.
- Setting all PIDs to 0x1FFF before switching channel.
- New setup parameter "VideoFormat" to define the aspect ratio of the tv set
  in use (4:3 or 16:9).

2001-06-26: Version 0.83

- Avoiding "Device or resource busy" error message when setting PIDs.
- Added Portugese language texts (thanks to Paulo Lopes).
- Recording and replaying Dolby Digital (AC3) sound.
- No longer getting stuck when a channel doesn't sync while switching
  with the 'Up' and 'Down' keys.

2001-07-22: Version 0.84

- Fixed video packet scanning to make it recognize the whole range of
  allowed video packet ids.
- Added an additional "emergency exit" in case channel switching doesn't
  work several times in a row (when will the driver finally become stable
  enough to allow rock solid channel switching??).
- No longer sending a Diseqc command if the Diseqc value for a given channel
  is '0'. Previously this caused problems with some multi-switches (thanks to
  Markus Lang and Ulrich Röder).
- When switching channels by entering the channel number via the numeric keys
  on the remote control, the channel number displayed is now followed by the
  '-' character to indicate that additional digits can be entered.
- Increased the timeout for numeric channel switching from 500ms to 1s.
- Fixed handling the "Green" button in the "Schedules" menu for channels that
  have a second audio PID.
- Fixed high system load when displaying a still picture in replay.
- Fixed a hanging SVDRP connection if the client dies without issuing QUIT.
- Increased the frame buffer size to 192KB.
- Removed a superfluous VIDEO_FREEZE call in the replay buffer.
- Added French language texts (thanks to Jean-Claude Repetto).
- Modified OSD to use 2bpp windows (4 colors) in order to work with less
  memory, allow a larger OSD window and be faster. The group separators in the
  "Channels" menu had to be given a different color.
- Moved the channel display to the bottom of the screen.
- Displaying the frame counter in the replay progress display only when editing
  a mark.
- Fixed handling characters above 0xEF in SVDRP.
- Fixed a possible crash in parsing incorrect lines in 'channels.conf'.
- New channel settings for Premiere World (Dolby Digital PIDs not yet
  available).
- Increased the buffer for key names received from LIRC (thanks to Andre
  Valentin).
- Fixed handling a channel group separator at the very beginning of the
  'channels.conf' file.

2001-07-29: Version 0.85

- Added Norwegian language texts (thanks to Jørgen Tvedt).
- Increased the usleep value in cDvbOsd::Cmd() to 5000 in order to work on
  systems with the KURT/utime-patch (thanks to Guido Fiala).
- Changed the check whether the driver is loaded in runvdr to check for the
  'dvb' module (the last one loaded).
- Fixed repeat function with LIRC (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Increased the upper limit for the symbol rate to 30000 (thanks to Ulrich
  Röder).
- Made the position of the channel display configurable (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Made the width and height of the OSD configurable (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- DiSEqC support can now be generally enabled/disabled in the Setup menu. This
  may be necessary if your multiswitch gets irritated by the default DiSEqC
  codes '0' (thanks to Markus Lang).
- Fixed replaying in case there is no index file.
- Fixed jumping to an editing mark when replay has been paused.
- Avoiding unnecessary code execution in the replay progress display (thanks
  to Guido Fiala).
- When entering time values the digits that still have to be entered are now
  shown as '-' (as in "1-:--").
- When setting an editing mark while the progress display is not active, the
  display will now be turned on for a short while to indicate the successful
  setting of the mark.
- Updated 'channels.conf' for Premiere World (thanks to Mel Schächner).
  Check your timers if you use this channels.conf file, since the sequence of
  several PW channels has been changed.
- Changed the color of "Info" messages to "black on green" and that of the
  confirmation messages (like "Delete...") to "black on yellow".
- Fixed display with DEBUG_OSD (it still crashes sometimes, esp. when replaying,
  but I can't seem to find what causes this... any ideas anybody?).
- Avoiding audio/video distortions in 'Transfer Mode' by no longer actually
  tuning the primary interface (which can't receive this channel, anyway).
  Apparently the driver gets irritated when the channel is switched and a
  replay session is started immediately after that.
- Increased timeout until reporting "video data stream broken" when recording.
- Explicitly switching back to the previously active channel after ending a
  replay session (to have it shown correctly in case it was in 'Transfer Mode').

2001-08-06: Version 0.90

- Modified the display of the channel group separators (thanks to Markus Lang
  for this suggestion).
- Added support for replaying DVDs (thanks to Andreas Schultz). See INSTALL for
  instructions on how to compile VDR with DVD support.
- Fixed replay progress display in case replay is paused while watching an
  ongoing recording.
- Ringbuffer uses semaphores to signal empty/full conditions.
- Fixed calculating the timeout value in cFile::FileReady() (thanks to
  Wolfgang Henselmann-Weiss).

2001-08-12: Version 0.91

- Fixed displaying colored button texts that are too long.
- Suppressing replay progress display when replaying a DVD.
- Updated channels.conf.cable (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Updated French OSD texts (thanks to Jean-Claude Repetto).
- Improved AC3 decoding when replaying DVDs (thanks to Matjaz Thaler).
- Fixed handling DVB card indexes when using only one card in a multi-card
  system.
- Changed the 'Eject DVD' button text to a simple 'Eject' (the German text
  was too long...).
- Made the font file generation more stable (thanks to Artur Skawina).
- Changed the default value for the "DiSEqC" setup parameter to "off".
- The new command line option '-E' can be used to define where the EPG data
  shall be written to. This is especially useful if VDR runs in a system
  that turns off the video disk when it is not used, and therefore needs
  to write the EPG file to a ramdisk (or turn off writing it alltogether).
  See 'vdr --help' for details.
- Making sure the disk is up and running before starting recording (this
  is important for systems that turn off the video disk when it is not used).
- Added the "Jump" function in replay mode (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
  See the description of the "Red" key in MANUAL under "Replay Control" for
  details.
- Fixed displaying editing marks when toggling a mark in "pause" mode.
- If there is no free DVB device to record, the log message will now be given
  only once.
- Made I/O more robust by handling EINTR (thanks to Werner Fink).

2001-08-18: Version 0.92

- The "channel not sync'ed" log message now also lists the card number.
- Now using the EIT services from 'libdtv' (thanks to Rolf Hakenes), which
  provides EPG information for NVOD ("Near Video On Demand") channels.
- Doing some bug fixing on the EPG data (some tv stations apparently have
  their own idea on how to fill in the data...). The level up to which EPG
  bugs are fixed can be controlled with the EPGBugfixLevel parameter in the
  "Setup" menu (see MANUAL for details, and cEventInfo::FixEpgBugs() in eit.c
  for the actual implementation).
- Fixed broken recordings after a driver buffer overflow.
- Fixed the chirping sound after Pause/Play of a DVD (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz).

2001-08-26: Version 0.93

- The menus and the channel display now show the current date and time.
- The new Setup parameter MaxVideoFileSize can be used to customize the
  maximum size of the recorded video files.
- Fixed a bug in handling repeating timers that record over midnight (the
  calculation of matching timers has been completely rewritten).
- Timers that are currently recording are now marked with '#' in the "Timers"
  menu.
- Timers are now sorted in the "Timers" menu, showing the sequence in which
  they will be recording. This can be disabled in the "Setup" menu. Note
  that the "Mark" button doesn't work if timers are displayed sorted.

2001-09-02: Version 0.94

- Implemented automatic shutdown (see INSTALL and MANUAL for details).
- New SVDRP command NEXT to show the next timer event.
- The new remote control key "Power" can be used to turn the VDR machine
  off (this requires the presence of the '-s' option).
- Fixed code for the default "Ok" button on the PC keyboard (was 0x162 on
  the "good old" keyboards (with the F-keys at the left side), while it changed
  to 0x15E on the newer keyboards).
- When a recording is edited, the summary information (if present) is now
  also copied.
- When a recording is running on the primary interface, any attempt to change
  the current channel will now lead to a "Channel locked" message.
- The main program loop now first checks whether any timer recordings are
  finished, before starting a new timer recording. This is important in case
  one timer ends at the same time another timer starts.
- New setup parameter OSDMessageTime to define how long an OSD message shall
  be displayed.
- The "File" parameter of a timer can now contain the '~' character to store
  the recording in a hierarchical directory structure. The '~' character has
  been chosen since the file system's directory delimiter '/' may be part of
  a regular programme name (showing the directory hierarchy in the "Recordings"
  menu will follow later).
- Repeating timers now create recordings that contain the 'Subtitle' information
  from the EPG data in their file name. Typically (on tv stations that care
  about their viewers) this contains the episode title of a series. The
  subtitle is appended to the timer's file name, separated by a '~' character,
  so that it results in all recordings of this timer being collected in a
  common subdirectory. You can disable this with the 'UseSubtitle' parameter
  in the "Setup" menu.
- The summary information is now taken from the EPG data at the actual time of
  recording (no longer at the time the timer is created in the "Schedule" menu).
  If a timer already has summary data, that data will be used. If you have
  repeating timers in your 'timers.conf', you may want to make sure they do
  NOT contain any summary information (that's the last field in the timer
  definitions). Use your favourite text editor to delete that information.
  That way every recording will store the actual summary data at the time of
  the recording.

2001-09-16: Version 0.95

- Fixed behaviour in case the shutdown didn't take place (there were many
  "next timer event at..." messages in that case).
- Reduced the default value for MinEventTimeout to 30 minutes.
- Fixed detecting manual start in shutdown feature.
- An error message is now displayed in case the 'Transfer Mode' can't be
  started because the necessary DVB card is currently recording (or there
  is no DVB card that can access this channel).
- Fixed toggling channels with the '0' key in case the "Ok" button has been
  pressed to display the current/next information.
- Pressing the "Power" key now always initiates the shutdown sequence (after
  user confirmation in case of a recording timer), event if there is currently
  a menu or a replay session active. Note the additional remarks in INSTALL
  regarding the values of the two parameters given to the shutdown program
  in case of a currently recording timer.
- Switching through channel groups with the "Left" and "Right" keys now
  always starts at the group that contains the current channel.
- Implemented "Multi Speed Mode" (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Implemented backtracing to hit the right spot after fast forward/rewind
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Implemented replay mode display (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt, with a few
  rewrites by kls).
- Changed the size of all input buffers used to parse config files or receive
  SVDRP commands to the same value of 10KB. This allows long strings to be
  used in the 'summary' field of a timer, for instance.
- The pipe to the Dolby Digital replay command (option '-a') now closes all
  unused file descriptors in the child process to avoid crashing when the
  OSD is used (thanks to Andreas Vitting).
- Switched to the driver's new tuning API (VDR now requires a driver version
  dated 2001-09-14 or higher).
- Changed obsolete macro VIDEO_WINDOW_CHROMAKEY to VID_TYPE_CHROMAKEY (thanks
  to Guido Fiala).
- New version of the "Master-Timer" tool (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- Better error handling when writing configuration files.
- Fixed putting the final editing mark into the edited version's marks file.
- Fixed manipulating an editing mark at the very end of a recording.
- Fixed starting a new replay immediately after stopping a previous one (had
  caused a mix between live video and replay).
- Three new keys ("Volume+", Volume-" and "Mute") to control the DVB card's
  audio output volume.
- New version of the 'epg2timers' tool (thanks to Carsten Koch).

2001-09-23: Version 0.96

- Made VDR compile with libdvdread-0.9.1 (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
  Note that you now _need_ version 0.9.1 of libdvdread to compile VDR with
  DVD support!
- Several fixes to the replay mode display (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt):
  no more replay mode display when pressing the "Green" or "Yellow" button
  (Skip +/-60s); fixed timeout when pressing '0' to set an editing mark while
  the progress display is not shown; mode display is shown after progress
  display is closed; pressing "Ok" while the mode display is on brings up
  the progress display; no more unnecessary display of "normal play mode".
- Supplying the new frontend parameter 'Inversion' (currently it is always
  set to INVERSION_AUTO, which should work with all channels on Astra).
- Removing unnecessary double quotes from EPG Subtitle in EPGBugfixLevel >=1.
- EPG info is now updated if the contents changes but the ID remains the same.
- Fixed handling SVDRP commands whith more than one blank between the command
  word and the options.
- The current volume setting is now saved to setup.conf and restored at the
  next program start.
- New command line option '-r' to define a command that gets called before and
  after each recording (see INSTALL for details).
- Implemented a check to see whether the system time is running linearly.
- Writing the current time (as seen by VDR) into the log file when starting
  a timer recording (this may help debugging cases where timers don't start
  at the expected time).
- Made the volume, mute and power keys work when a menu is active, too (thanks
  to Matthias Weingart).

2001-10-21: Version 0.97

- Implemented a lock file to prevent more than one instance of VDR from removing
  files from the video directory at the same time.
- The new setup parameter SplitEditedFiles can be used to control whether or
  not the result of an editing process shall be written into separate files.
- Fixed handling repeat function when using LIRC (thanks to Matthias Weingart).
- The shutdown program (defined with the '-s' option) now also gets the channel
  number and recording title of the timer (see INSTALL).
- New channel data for 'Premiere One', 'Premiere X-Action', 'Fox Kids Türkce'
  and 'N24' (thanks to Andreas Share, Ulrich Röder, Uwe Scheffler and Simon
  Bauschulte). Note that if you are using the default 'channels.conf' or
  'channels.conf.cable' files you may need to check any exiting timers to see
  whether they still use the correct channel number.
- Fixed the "EPG bugfix" (sometimes had duplicate information in Subtitle and
  Extended Description).
- Fixed checking for valid video device when setting the video mode.
- The external command 'sort' is no longer required. VDR now sorts the list of
  recordings itself, making sure that recordings that stem from repeating timers
  are sorted chronologically. Sorting is done according to the setting of the
  current locale, so you may want to make sure LC_COLLATE is set to the desired
  value (see INSTALL).
- Fixed handling 'newline' characters in EPG texts (thanks to Rolf Hakenes for
  an improved version of his 'libdtv').
  Newline characters are always mapped to a single "blank" in VDR, because they
  would otherwise disturb the Title and Subtitle layout in the channel display
  (where these are assumed to be single line texts) and would have to be
  specially handled in the 'epg.data' file and the LSTE command in SVDRP.
- Mapping ` ("backtick") characters in EPG texts to ' (single quote).
- Fixed timers starting and ending at unexpected times. 'localtime()' was not
  thread safe, now using localtime_r().
- Removed the "system time seen..." message.
- Fixed a bug in the replay mode display when pressing the Green or Yellow
  button while in trick mode (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt)
- Closing all open file descriptors when calling external programs.
- The menu timeout now also works when pressing the "Back" button during replay
  to enter the "Recordings" menu.
- Updated 'channels.conf' for the "Bundesliga" channels of Premiere World
  (thanks to Mel Schächner).
- Fixed reading timers.conf and channels.conf that contain blanks after numeric
  values.
- Fixed handling trick modes near the beginning and end of a recording.
- Pressing the "Back" button while replaying a DVD now leads to the DVD menu.

2001-11-04: Version 0.98

- Completed storing the current audio volume in the setup.conf file (thanks
  to Andy Grobb).
- Fixed closing the progress display with the "Back" key when in trick mode
  and Setup.ShowReplayMode is enabled (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- New SVDRP commands LSTR and DELR to list and delete recordings (thanks to
  Thomas Heiligenmann).
- Fixed a crash when pressing the '2' button while replaying a DVD.
- Updated 'channels.conf' for the "Bundesliga" channels of Premiere World
  (thanks to Mel Schächner).
- Changed the tuning code to use FrontendInfo to detect the type of DVB card.
- Removed the recursion stuff from cThread (cMutex already does this).
- Fixed handling the repeat function in the channel display.
- Avoiding multiple EPG entries for the same event (thanks to Rolf Hakenes
  for some valuable information on how to do this).
- A recording on the primary interface can now be stopped to make it continue
  on an other free DVB card (if one is free at the moment). See MANUAL for
  details.
- Added some missing teletext PIDs (thanks to Norbert Schmidt).
- Added PTS to the converted PCM audio when replaying a DVD (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz). Now the audio and video of a DVD replayed over the DVB card's A/V
  out should always be in sync.
- Fixed handling the "Power" key in case Setup.MinUserInactivity is set to 0 to
  disable automatic shutdown.
- Added a fifth parameter to the 'shutdown' call that indicates the reason for
  this shutdown request (see INSTALL).
- Fixed releasing 'index' memory after recording or playback.
- Fixed ejecting a DVD while it is being replayed.
- Removed all video overlay stuff from cDvbApi and SVDRP. Guido Fiala's new
  'kvdr' version 0.4 now does these things itself. As a consequence of this you
  will now need to use kvdr 0.4 or later.
- The device /dev/video is now opened only if necessary (to GRAB an image),
  allowing other programs (like 'kvdr', for instance) to use that device.

2001-11-25: Version 0.99pre1

- Fixed several channel definitions in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Thilo
  Wunderlich).
- Added MPEG audio support for DVD (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Implemented DVB-T support (thanks to Dave Chapman).
  This currently works only for UK channels.
- Removed the range limits for the Frequency and Srate parameters of channel
  definitions.
- Changed the maximum value for PIDs in channels.conf from 0xFFFE to 0x1FFF.
- Fixed DVD audio sync problems (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Fixed external AC3 replay for DVDs (thanks to Andreas Schultz).

2002-01-27: Version 0.99pre2

- Fixed setting the OSD size in the 'Confirm' interface call (thanks to
  Deti Fliegl).
- Removed the 'read incomplete section...' error message in the EIT processor.
- Fixed channel data for "DW TV" (thanks to Axel Gruber).
- Added DPID to "PREMIERE MOVIE 1" in channels.conf.cable (thanks to Stephan
  Schreiber).
- Prepared the OSD functions for multiple overlapping windows.
- Removed the check to see whether the system time is running linearly.
- Improved performance of SVDRP command entry.
- Removed EPGBugfixLevel '3' - after more than a year Pro-7 finally managed to
  broadcast the correct timestamps for EPG events between 0:00 and 6:00!
- Fixed failing watchdog timer if program hangs in OSD activities (thanks to
  Carsten Koch).
- No longer requiring 'libncurses' if compiling without DEBUG_OSD=1 and
  REMOTE=KBD (thanks to Lauri Pesonen).
- The "Recordings" menu now displays a hierarchical structure if there are
  subdirectories for the recordings. This can be controlled through the
  "RecordingDirs" parameter in the "Setup" menu.
  See "MANUAL/Replaying a Recording" for details.
- Improved speed of setting the Help button texts.
- Fixed handling file names that contain single quotes (') or dollar signs ($)
  in the call to the shutdown command (option '-s') and the recording command
  (option '-r').
- Improved error handling in the editing process; the resulting file will be
  deleted if an error occured.
- A message is now prompted at the end of the editing process, indicating
  whether the process succeeded or failed.
- Fixed setting the LastActivity timestamp after a shutdown prompt (thanks to
  Sergei Haller).
- A message is now prompted if free disk space becomes low during recording.
- The editing process now calls AssertFreeDiskSpace() to remove deleted
  recordings if the disk becomes full.
- The "Main" menu now displays in its title the used disk space (in percent)
  and the estimated free disk space (in hh:mm), assuming a data rate of 30 MB
  per minute.
- Activating the "Recordings" menu now displays "scanning recordings..." to
  give the user some feedback in case this takes longer.
- Status messages are now displayed centered.
- Removed the 'Tools' subdirectory from the VDR archive. All contributed tools
  can now be found at ftp://ftp.cadsoft.de/pub/people/kls/vdr/Tools.

2002-01-29: Version 0.99pre3

- Fixed handling improper buffer lengths in the EIT parser (thanks to Deti
  Fliegl).

2002-01-30: Version 0.99pre4

- Fixed handling improperly formatted EIT data (thanks to Rolf Hakenes).

2002-02-03: Version 0.99pre5

- Updated channel settings for 'N24' (thanks to Andreas Gebel).
- Fixed handling hierarchical recordings menu in case of directories starting
  with the same sequence of characters.
- Fixed handling timers on the 29th, 30th or 31st of a month in case the next
  month has less than 31 days.
- Added a description of the sort order of individual episodes in the
  recordings menu to the MANUAL.
- Removed the EPG bugfix for "Title / Subtitle" cleanup. Apparently Pro-7 has
  finally stopped this nasty habit.
- Added some EPG bugfix statistics (printed to the log file every time the EPG
  data is cleaned up and when VDR is terminated). Maybe somebody in charge of
  the EPG data at the listed channels will read this and take the necessary
  actions to fix these things...
- Changed the [dei]syslog macros in tools.h to use a variable number of args,
  thus making it safe to use them in nested 'if/else' statements.
- Fixed error handling in establishing an SVDRP connection (thanks to Davide
  Achilli for pointing out this one).
- The new configuration file 'svdrphosts.conf' is now used to define which
  hosts may access the SVDRP port (by default only 'localhost' has access).
  See FORMATS for details.
- The special keywords TITLE and EPISODE can now be used in timer file names
  (see MANUAL and FORMATS for details).
- The new setup parameter NameInstantRecord can be used to define how an
  instant recording will be named (see MANUAL for details).
- When looking for the EPG record of the timer that starts a recording, now
  that record is taken which covers the time calculated as
  'start + (Setup.MarginStart * 2) + 1)' in order to have a better chance of
  hitting the right record in case of an instant recording. Timers that start
  further in the future should always be programmed via the "Schedules" menu.
- The special VPIDs '0' and '1' are now used to enable recording radio channels.
  Actually '0' should be enough, but '1' must be used with encrypted channels
  (driver bug?). Note, though, that since VDR is mainly a *video recorder*, some
  features like, e. g.,  the progress display, may not work as expected with
  radio recordings. Thanks to Michael Paar.
- Fixed a problem with the ERR macro defined by ncurses.h (thanks to Artur
  Skawina).

2002-02-10: Version 0.99

- Fixed a bug in moving timers or channels to the last position in the list
  (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer for helping to debug this one).
- Changed the estimated data rate for calculating the remaining disk capacity
  to 25.75 MB/min.
- Only reporting the 'EPG bugfix statistics' if there really were any fixes.
- Added Finnish language texts (thanks to Hannu Savolainen).
- Reverted to the previous way of searching for the EPG record of the current
  recording in case of a repeating timer (i.e. taking the one that is in the
  middle between start and end time).
- Added a typedef for 'in_addr_t' to make it work with glibc < 2.2 (thanks to
  Jürgen Schmidt).
- When the last entry in a "Recordings" menu page is deleted, that page is now
  automatically closed (suggested by Uwe Freese).
- Changed the default name for instant recordings to "TITLE EPISODE" (avoiding
  the '-').
- If Setup.ShowInfoOnChSwitch is set to "no", the box for the EPG display is no
  longer shown (thanks to Andy Grobb).
- If compiled with VFAT=1, characters that can't be handled by a VFAT system are
  now encoded to '#XX'.
- When the user presses the "Power" button and there is a timer about to start
  recording within Setup.MinEventTimeout minutes, there is now a confirmation
  prompt telling the user that there is an upcoming timer event.
- If a recording has no episode title, the trailing '~' is no longer shown in
  the progress display.

2002-02-24: Version 1.0.0pre1

- Added scanning for EPG data for another 4 days on channels that support this
  (thanks to Oleg Assovski).
- Removed '#define VFAT 1' from recording.c (was a leftover from testing).
- Fixed the "Low disk space!" message (thanks to Sergei Haller).
- Added the TPID to Hessen-3 in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Sergei Haller).
- Fixed a crash when replaying with DEBUG_OSD=1 (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Implemented the "First day" parameter for repeating timers. See FORMATS for
  information about the enhanced 'timers.conf' file format, and MANUAL for
  a description of the new item in the "Edit Timer" menu and the enhanced
  functionality of the "Blue" button in the "Timers" menu.
- When deleting a recording that is currently still being recorded, the related
  timer will now automatically be terminated. If this is a repeating timer, it
  will receive a "First day" setting that skips the timer for this day.
- Fixed closing all unused file descriptors when opening a pipe (thanks to
  Werner Fink).
- Instant recordings now take the EPG data from the point in time at 5 minutes
  from the start time of the recording. In order for this to work the 'active'
  parameter of a timer now uses the second bit to indicate that this is an
  "instant" recording (see FORMATS for details).
- Fixed the SVDRP GRAB command in case the video device can't be opened (thanks
  to Adrian Stabiszewski).
- At startup the data written into 'epg.data' is now read into the EPG data
  structures. In order for this to work, the 'E' record has been extended to
  (optionally) contain the 'table ID' (see FORMATS for details).
- The new SVDRP command PUTE can be used to put EPG data into the EPG list.
  See FORMATS for details about the required data format.
- Taking the German umlauts 'as is' when compiled with VFAT.
- The new Setup parameter RecordDolbyDigital can be used to generally turn off
  recording the Dolby Digital audio channels in case you want to save disk space
  or don't have the equipment to replay Dolby Digital audio.
- Reading the 'setup.conf' file no longer terminates in case of an error, but
  rather attempts to read the rest of the file.
- Removed DVD support from the core VDR source, since the current version from
  Andreas Schultz is already much further developed (DVD menu navigation) and
  the concept of "additional players" in VDR is going to change in version 1.1.0,
  where a new "plugin" interface shall allow the easy implementation of new
  players without having to patch the core VDR source. Until then, Andreas has
  agreed to provide his DVD support as a completely external patch.
- The contents of the distribution archive now contains the directory name with
  the current version number, as in 'vdr-1.0.0pre1/...' in order to avoid
  inadvertently overwriting an existing VDR directory with a new version.
- Added a missing error message in SVDRP command LSTC in case the given channel
  can't be found.

2002-02-25: Version 1.0.0pre2

- Fixed a crash in case there is no 'epg.data' at program start (thanks to
  Andreas Schultz).

2002-03-03: Version 1.0.0pre3

- Fixed parsing 'E' records in epg2html.pl.
- Fixed a deadlock when switching channels via Schedule/Now|Next/Switch (reported
  by Martin Hammerschmid).
- Changed the meaning of the 'Ca' parameter in 'channels.conf'. Each channel can
  now define which decryption method it needs in order to be accessed. The new
  configuration file 'ca.conf' contains the defined values, and the default
  'channels.conf' has been modifed to contain the new values for 'Premiere World'
  and 'ORF'. If you use the default 'channels.conf' and have the conditional
  access hardware to receive encrypted channels, please make sure you copy the
  file 'ca.conf' into your /video directory (or wherever your configuration files
  are located) and go into the "Setup" menu and set the CICAM values according
  to your hardware setup. Currently there are two possible CICAM entries per
  DVB card, so any card can implement up to two different conditional access
  modes (besides the default "Free To Air" mode, which is always assumed to be
  available on any DVB card).
- Updated French language texts (thanks to Jean-Claude Repetto).

2002-03-17: Version 1.0.0pre4

- Added 'Ca' code 201 for 'Cryptoworks, GOD-DIGITAL' to 'ca.conf' (thanks to
  Bernd Schweikert).
- Fixed avoiding the primary DVB interface in case Setup.PrimaryLimit is 0.
- Fixed handling CICAM settings if the first one of a DVB card was FTA.
- Fixed reacting on changes in CICAM settings (needed to restart VDR before).
- The "Blue" button in the "Main" menu now works as "Stop" button if a recording
  is currently being replayed.
- New command line option '-m' to mute audio of the primary DVB device at
  startup (suggested by Mirko Günther).
- The new SVDRP command VOLU can be used to control the audio volume (suggested
  by Mirko Günther).
- Fixed resetting 'mute' state when setting the volume to a non-zero value.
- Added log messages when deleting recordings in case the disk runs full while
  recording.
- Fixed closing a pipe (used for replaying Dolby Digital audio), which
  sometimes left 'zombie' processes behind (thanks to Werner Fink for helping
  to debug this one).
- Now starting the Dolby Digital output thread only if the recording actually
  contains Dolby Digital audio data (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Implemented OSD for Volume and Mute (works only if there is no other OSD
  activity, but this should be no problem for normal use).
- Changed the MANUAL description of the "Conditional Access" setup parameters
  to reflect the actual "CICAM DVBn m" notation in the "Setup" menu.
- The new Setup parameter "Use time from transponder" can be used to define which
  transponder shall be used to set the system time (see MANUAL for details).
  If you have been using the SetSystemTime option previously, you now MUST
  select a channel that you trust to have a reliable time base.
- Grouped the Setup parameters into several sub-menus, so that each group of
  parameters fits on a single screen - unless the height of the OSD has been
  set to a small value (based on code from Markus Lang).
- Changed the title of the "Main" menu to "VDR".
- Fixed displaying a system message while the replay mode is being shown.
- Physically removing a deleted recording if one with the same name shall be
  deleted again.
- The "Left" and "Right" keys are now used to page up and down in text displays
  (like the EPG descriptions or the results of commands executed from the
  "Commands" menu).
- Fixed high CPU usage in 'Transfer Mode'.
- Replaced 'killproc' with 'killall' in 'runvdr', since apparently 'killproc'
  is not available by default on some Linux distributions, whereas 'killall' is.
  Please check if your system provides 'killall' - if it doesn't, please change
  this back in 'runvdr' and report this (thanks to Achim Lange).
- The "Commands" menu now automatically assigns number keys as hotkeys to the
  commands. If you have preceeded your commands with digits you may want to
  remove these from your 'commands.conf' file.
- The new Setup item "Restart" can be used to force a complete restart of VDR,
  including reloading the driver. Note that this can only work if VDR and the
  driver are wrapped into a mechanism that actually performs this action if VDR
  exits. The 'runvdr' script can be used for this purpose.
- Refined texts of the "Setup" menu.

2002-04-01: Version 1.0.0pre5

- Fixed restoring CICAM setup values for a fourth DVB card (thanks to Klaus Wolf).
- Completed internationalization of OSD texts (thanks to Hannu Savolainen,
  Arnold Niessen, Paulo Lopes, Jean-Claude Repetto, Alberto Carraro, Matjaz
  Thaler and Truls Slevigen).
- Improved file I/O in case of EINTR, which may occur e.g. with heavy system
  load (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Now writing the title of a recording into the 'summary.vdr' file.
- Workaround for displaying still frames with the unpatched LinuxDVB driver
  (if anybody ever finds out why the unpatched driver doesn't display VDR's
  still frames, please let me know).
- When executing a command from the "Commands" menu, the title of that command
  is now immediately shown in the status line (followed by "...") to give the
  user some feedback that the command is being executed, which is especially
  important if this takes some time.
- Fixed scrolling the "Channels" menu in case the cursor ends up on a group
  delimiter (thanks to Bernd Zierath for helping to debug this one).
- Added manual pages vdr(1) and vdr(5) (which made the FORMATS file obsolete).
- New command command line option '-V' to display the VDR version.
- Adjusting column width for channel numbers in case there are more than 999
  channels.
- Checking the return value of '...FileReady...' calls in dvbapi.c for better
  performance under heavy system load.
- New 'make' target 'install', which copies the manual pages and executables
  to their appropriate system locations and creates the /video directory if
  it doesn't exist yet.
- Automatic hotkey assignment is now suppressed if the first entry in
  'commands.conf' starts with a digit in the range '1'...'9', followed by a blank.
- Fixed a bug in switching back the replay mode display in time shift mode
  (thanks to Achim Lange for reporting this one).
- Fixed a bug in the "First day" timer parameter for timers that record over
  midnight.
- Added units to Setup parameters.
- Changed time entry in the 'Jump' command during replay, so that it is filled
  up from right to left.
- Now using statfs() to determine the amount of free disk space, which avoids
  the use of an external 'df' command (thanks to Ruben Nunez Francisco).
- Fixed skipping the next hit of a repeating timer (thanks to Rainer Zocholl
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed a bug when a timer records over midnight of a day that had a change in
  Daylight Saving Time (thanks to Mirko Dölle for reporting this one).
- Added Polish language texts (thanks to Michael Rakowski).
- Fixed a bug in parsing group separators in channels.conf (thanks to Henning
  Holtschneider for reporting this one).
- Changed the default 'Ok' key when using the PC keyboard from '5' (in the
  numeric block) to 'Enter', because the '5' key didn't work on keyboards with
  the F-keys on top.
- Fixed a bug in the EPG bugfix mechanism if the extended description is shorter
  than 3 characters (thanks to Andreas Schultz).

2002-04-07: Version 1.0.0

- Fixed a problem with wrong EPG data in the Schedules menu (thanks to Tobias
  Kerner, problem was initially reported by Michel Moster, but somehow I had
  misplaced his message...).
- Added Spanish language texts (thanks to Ruben Nunez Francisco).
- Fixed resetting the "First day" timer parameter once the timer actually starts
  recording.
- Fixed the still picture workaround in case the progress display is active
  (thanks to Gerald Raaf).
- Fixed a problem with accessing the epg.data file before it is fully written
  (thanks to Thilo Wunderlich for reporting this one).
- Now the EPG scan skips channels that have their 'Ca' parameter explicitly set
  to an other DVB card (suggested by Sergei Haller).
- Fixed a possible hangup when reading a broken epg.data file (thanks to Henning
  Holtschneider for pointing out this one).
- Fixed a bug in the editing process in case a previously edited file with the
  same name was manually deleted on a system with more than one video directory
  (thanks to Dirk Wiebel for reporting this one).

2002-04-21: Version 1.0.1

- Added some DVB-T channels for Berlin (Germany) to channels.conf.terr (thanks to
  Andreas Roedl).
- Implemented enhanced string editing with upper-/lowercase, insert/overwrite
  and delete (thanks to Sergei Haller).
- Fixed color palette handling on "big endian" systems (thanks to Jean Martin
  for pointing out this one).
- Updated the "Blue Movie" channels to the new "Premiere Erotik" (thanks to
  Thilo Wunderlich). NOTE: this adds a new channel to 'channels.conf', so that
  any timers referencing a channel with a number higher than 102 should be
  checked and adapted if necessary (this only applies if you are using the default
  'channels.conf').
- Improved thread locking in the ring buffer to avoid possible race conditions
  under heavy load (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Fixed a crash when selecting the "Jump" function directly after setting an
  editing mark (thanks to Steffen Koch for reporting and Stefan Huelswitt for
  fixing this one).
- Fixed some missing ',' in i18n.c (thanks to Matthias Hilbig).
- Fixed a possible endless loop in shifting recordings between DVB cards (thanks
  to Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Updated the Premiere World Formula 1 channels in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Mel
  Schächner).
- No longer setting PIDs 0x1FFF, which apparently fixes problems with CAMs and
  AC3 sound only working the first time (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Now encoding '.' at the end of a directory name in case of VFAT=1, since Windows
  can't handle these (thanks to Simon Dean for reporting this one).

2002-05-05: Version 1.0.2

- Now taking an active video cutting process into account when doing shutdown or
  housekeeping (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- The default duration of an instant recording has been increased to 3 hours and
  is now configurable in the "Setup/Recording" menu.
- Added Greek language texts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Fixed the unit of the "SVDRP timeout" setup parameter (thanks to Marcus Kuba
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed a crash on systems with disks that have a block size larger than 1MB
  (thanks to Ulrich Petri for helping to debug this one).
- Updated 'channels.conf' for the new PW settings (thanks to Andreas Share,
  Carsten Koch, Gerald Raaf and Mel Schächner). Note that all channels with numbers
  over 50 may have moved, so you should carefully check any timers you have set!
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' for the new PW settings (thanks to Oliver Lorei
  Stephan Schreiber and Uwe Scheffler). Note that all channels may have moved, so
  you should carefully check any timers you have set!
  For future updates of this file somebody with digital cable should take the role
  of the "maintainer" and send me updated versions based on the file that comes
  with the most recent version of VDR. I will then simply replace the entire file
  'channels.conf.cable' whenever a new version is sent to me.
- Fixed skipping forward in time shift mode near the end of the recording (thanks
  to Andreas Böttger for reporting this one).

2002-05-09: Version 1.1.0

- Begin of the 1.1 development branch. THIS IS NOT A STABLE VERSION!
  The current stable version for every day use is still the 1.0 branch.
- First step towards a universal plugin interface. See the file PLUGINS.html
  for a detailed description. The man page vdr(1) describes the new options '-L'
  and '-P' used to load plugins. This first step implements the complete "outer"
  shell for plugins. The "inner" access to VDR data structures will follow.
- The VDR version number is now displayed in the title line of the "Setup" menu.

2002-05-11: Version 1.1.1

- Separated the actual DVB hardware OSD implementation from the abstract OSD
  interface. 'osdbase.c/.h' now implements the abstract OSD, while 'dvbosd.c/.h'
  is the actual implementation for the DVB hardware. This is in preparation for
  allowing additional kinds of OSD hardware implementations.
- Fixed leftover references to the file FORMATS in MANUAL and svdrp.c (thanks to
  Onno Kreuzinger for reporting this one).
- Avoiding ambiguities in the cList template class in case one defines a "list of
  lists" (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Simplified the basic cMenuSetupPage class for easier use in plugins.
- Added setup parameters and a Setup menu to the 'hello' plugin example.
- Fixed logging error message for unknown config parameters in plugins.
- Rearranged cleanup sequence at the end of the main program.
- Adapted PLUGINS.html to use the actual code examples from the 'hello' plugin.

2002-05-13: Version 1.1.2

- Changed the cPlugin::Start() function to return a boolean value that indicates
  if the plugin will not be able to perform its task (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added the cPlugin::Housekeeping() function (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Updated channels.conf.cable (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Added 'insert' capabilities to cList (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Changed the 'package' target in the plugin's Makefile to produce a package that
  expands to a directory with just the plugin name and version number (suggested
  by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Made the config directory available to plugins (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
  See PLUGINS.html, section "Configuration files" for details.
- Improved the [eid]syslog() macros, so that the LOG_... macros don't need to be
  given any more.

2002-05-26: Version 1.0.3

- Updated 'Premiere Sport 2' in channels.conf (thanks to Rudi Hofer).
- Fixed some function headers to make them compile with gcc 3.x (thanks to
  Gregoire Favre).
- Fixed the cutting mechanism to make it re-sync in case a frame is larger than the
  buffer (thanks to Sven Grothklags).
- Added Swedish language texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).

2002-06-10: Version 1.0.4

- Added Romanian language texts (thanks to Paul Lacatus).
- Removed compiler option '-m486' to make it work on non-Intel platforms (thanks
  to Alastair McKinstry for pointing this out).

2002-06-16: Version 1.1.3

- Improved the VDR Makefile to avoid a warning if the '.dependencies' file does
  not exist, and also using $(MAKE) to call recursive makes.
- Changed the name of the 'package' target in the plugin Makefiles to 'dist'
  (following the suggestions in the "GNU Make" manual). If you already have started
  a plugin project, you may want to change this in your Makefile accordingly.
- Improved the plugin Makefile to avoid a warning if the '.dependencies' file does
  not exist, and also using $(shell...) to get the version numbers. If you already have
  started a plugin project, you may want to change this in your Makefile accordingly.
- Fixed some function headers to make them compile with gcc 3.x (thanks to
  Gregoire Favre).
- Fixed the cutting mechanism to make it re-sync in case a frame is larger than the
  buffer (thanks to Sven Grothklags).
- Added an error message if the directory specified in the '-L' option can't be
  accessed (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Rearranged OSD class names to make 'cOsd' available for the main OSD interface.
- Completely moved OSD handling out of the cDvbApi class, into the new cOsd.
- Implemented cStatus to allow plugins to set up a status monitor.
  See PLUGINS.html for details.
- Moved the cEITScanner out of dvbapi.h/.c, into the new eitscan.h/.c.
- Added Swedish language texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).
- Fixed parsing 'E' records in epg2html.pl (thanks to Matthias Fechner for pointing
  out this one).
- Removed compiler option '-m486' to make it work on non-Intel platforms. If you
  have already started a plugin project, you may want to make sure you remove this
  option from your existing Makefile.
- Completely rearranged the recording and replay functions to make them available
  to plugins.
- Replay is now done in a single thread (no more syncing between input and output
  thread necessary).
- It is now possible to record several channels on the same transponder with "budget
  cards". VDR automatically attaches a recording timer to a card that already
  records on the appropriate transponder. How many parallel recordings can actually
  be done depends on the computer's performance. Currently any number of recordings
  gets attached to a card, so you should carefully plan your timers to not exceed
  the limit. On a K6-II/450 it was possible to record three channels from transponder
  12480 with a single WinTV NOVA-S.
- Timers that record two successive shows on the same channel may now overlap and
  will use the same DVB card. During the time where both timers record the data
  is simply saved to both files.
- The following limitations apply to this version:
  + 'Transfer Mode' doesn't work yet.
  + The '-a' option (for Dolby Digital audio) doesn't work yet.
  + Switching between different language tracks doesn't work yet.
  + Cutting doesn't work yet.

2002-06-23: Version 1.1.4

- Added Hungarian language texts (thanks to Istvan Koenigsberger and Guido Josten).
- Activated cutting.
- Activated 'Transfer Mode'.
- Moved handling of the Menu key entirely into vdr.c.
- Switched VDR's own player to the new cPlayer/cControl structures.
- Switched handling 'Transfer Mode' to the new cPlayer/cControl structures.
- The following limitations apply to this version:
  + The '-a' option (for Dolby Digital audio) doesn't work yet.
  + Switching between different language tracks doesn't work yet.

2002-07-21: Version 1.1.5

- Added direct access to the index data of cPalette (needed for displaying SPUs,
  thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- The status monitor function cStatus::Replaying() now gets a 'cControl *' argument instead
  of a 'cDvbPlayerControl *' in order to allow additional players to call this function.
  cPlayer and cControl have been given the functions GetIndex() and GetReplayMode() to
  allow access to the player's status.
- Added cOsd::OpenRaw() to create a raw OSD (needed for displaying SPUs).
- Changed the symantics of the Name parameter in cStatus::Recording() and
  cStatus::Replaying(). It is no longer the full directory name of the recording,
  but rather just the basic name. This has been changed to allow players that can't
  provide a name to simply use a string that describes the player type (like, e.g.,
  "DVD").
- Fixed a hangup when switching to the next file during replay.
- Fixed a possible race condition in the cDvbPlayer (thanks to Andreas Schultz
  for pointing out this one).
- Disabled channels on Transponder 12070 in 'channels.conf', which apparently no longer transmits.

2002-08-04: Version 1.1.6

- Re-visited the race condition fix in the cDvbPlayer (thanks again to Andreas
  Schultz).
- Changed the VFAT handling to allow users who normally use it but have forgotten
  to set it when compiling a new version of VDR to at least see their recordings
  made with VFAT enabled (thanks to Christian Rienecker).
- Added some missing teletext PIDs (thanks to Joerg Riechardt).
- Fixed PID handling for cReceiver.
- Added a missing #include to ringbuffer.c (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid).
- Now using CC, CFLAGS, CXX and CXXFLAGS in Makefile.
- Changed the cDevice class to allow plugins to implement their own devices (see
  PLUGINS.html for details).

2002-08-16: Version 1.1.7

- Adapted VDR to the NEWSTRUCT driver. To use the new driver, compile VDR with
  'make NEWSTRUCT=1' (thanks to Holger Wächtler for some valuable advice).
  By default it currently still uses the old driver.
- Added some missing #includes (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid).
- Changed the log error message "can't record MPEG1!" to "error in data stream!",
  since the mentioning of MPEG1 has irritated many people.
- Consistently using malloc/free and new/delete (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Temporarily made cDevice::ProvidesCa() virtual (Andreas Schultz needs this
  in his DXR3 plugin).
- cDevice no longer exposes a file handle to cPlayer. A derived cPlayer class
  can now call DevicePoll() to see whether the replay device is ready for
  further data. A derived cDevice class must implement Poll() and shall
  check if any of its file handles is ready for data.
- Implemented several replay modes to allow players that play only audio (thanks
  to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Improved cCondVar::Wait() and implemented cCondVar::TimedWait() (thanks to
  Stefan Huelswitt).
- VDR no longer gives up if there is no DVB device. It continues to work if
  there is at least one device, either a DVB device found by the core VDR code
  itself, or a device implemented by a plugin.

2002-08-25: Version 1.1.8

- Fixed replaying the last few seconds of a recording.
- Added some missing #includes to files in libdtv for gcc 3.2 (thanks to Jürgen
  Zimmermann).
- Added cDevice::NewOsd() to allow a derived cDevice class to implement its own
  OSD capabilities (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Added cPalette::AllColors() for plugins that need to get the color entries of
  a cPalette (see osdbase.h).
- The new SVDRP command CLRE can be used to clear the entire EPG data (suggested
  by Matthias Schniedermeyer).
- Fixed handling one-shot timers that were already recording and had their start
  time changed into the future (thanks to Matthias Schniedermeyer for reporting
  this one).

2002-09-08: Version 1.1.9

- Fixed the 'newplugin' script to make it name the target for creating the
  distribution package 'dist', as stated in the PLUGINS.html documentation.
  If you have already created a plugin source directory and Makefile you may
  want to check it and replace the 'package' target with 'dist' if necessary.
- Changed device handling for being able to do simultaneous recording and
  replay on the same device (Time Shifting). In order for this to work you need
  to use a driver with a firmware version that has this feature implemented.
- cDevice::ProvidesCa() is no longer virtual. The new function
  cDevice::ProvidesChannel() is now used to determine whether a device can
  receive a given channel, and by default this function returns false. So a
  device that is a pure replaying device doesn't need to do anything here.
- Increased the recorder buffer size to 5MB in order to be able to better handle
  multiple recordings.
- Implemented cTSBuffer for better handling TS packet buffering in derived
  cDevice classes.
- Changed the interface if cDevice::GetTSPacket() to avoid unnecessary copying
  of data.
- Removed cDevice::Channel(), since this makes no more sense with devices
  receiving multiple channels.
- Switching through channels with the 'Up' and 'Down' keys now skips channels
  that are currently not available (for instance because all devices are
  recording and these channels are on different transponders).
- Implemented an SPU decoder (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Fixed a crash when entering an integer value outside the limits (thanks to
  Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Added play mode pmAudioOnlyBlack (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).

2002-09-15: Version 1.1.10

- Removed a superfluous error message from cLockFile::Unlock() (reported by
  Helmut Auer).
- Fixed starting a recording of the current channel with only one DVB card
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt for his help).
- A previous 'Transfer Mode' is now automatically re-started after a replay
  stops.
- Only calling cStatus::MsgChannelSwitch() if a channel is actually going to
  be switched or has actually been switched successfully (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- The EPG now drops events from "other" streams that have a duration of 86400
  seconds or more (this avoids bogus entries like "PROGRAMMES ALLEMANDS").
- Fixed opening /dev/video in cDvbDevice::GrabImage() in case of NEWSTRUCT
  driver (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Added a missing StripAudioPackets() to cDvbPlayer::Action() (thanks to
  Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added an EPG bugfix for the latest VOX EPG data format.

2002-09-29: Version 1.1.11

- Fixed an incomplete initialization of the filter parameters in eit.c (thanks
  to Jeremy Hall).
- Fixed the 'newplugin' script for use with the NEWSTRUCT driver (thanks to
  Andreas Schultz for reporting this one). If you have already created a plugin
  directory and Makefile with 'newplugin', please apply the following patch to it:

   ### The object files (add further files here):
  -------------------------------------------------------

  This is the diff for the 'setup' example that comes with VDR, so your line
  numbers may be different.
- Added a missing 'public' keyword in device.h (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid).
- Fixed a race condition when starting 'Transfer Mode'.
- Rearranged the remote control key handling to allow plugins to implement
  additional types of remote controls (see PLUGINS.html, section "Remote Control").
  The previously used files 'keys.conf' and 'keys-pc.conf' have been replaced
  by the file 'remote.conf', which holds the key definitions of all remote controls.
- The LIRC remote control keys are now handled just like the keyboard and RCU keys.
  This means that you can use the lircd.conf file as is for your remote control,
  without the need of editing it to make the key names the same as used in VDR.
  When first starting VDR it will go into the "Learning keys" mode and ask you
  to press the various keys. The resulting key assignment will be stored in
  the file 'remote.conf'.
  Since I have no way of testing the LIRC support, I hope I didn't break it in
  the process...
- While learning the remote control keys it is now possible to press the 'Menu'
  key to skip the definition of keys that are not available on your particular
  RC unit.
- Fixed handling DVD subtitles in the SPU decoder (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Avoiding restarts due to 'panic level' when switching channels on the primary
  device during EPG scan.

2002-10-06: Version 1.1.12

- Fixed a missing Flush() call in the remote control learning procedure (thanks
  to Oliver Endriss).
- Modified channel handling to cover all parameters necessary for DVB-C and DVB-T
  (see man vdr(5) for the meaning of the additional parameters stored in the field
  previously named 'polarisation'). Thanks to Uwe Scheffler and Andy Carter for testing.
  If you have a system with different kinds of DVB cards, like DVB-T and DVB-C,
  for instance, there is no more need to distinguish the channels through the
  'Ca' parameter in order to assign them to the various DVB cards. This is now
  taken care of by the "source" parameter. So a channel marked as "terrestrial",
  for example, will only be received on DVB-T cards.
  Note that the cChannel class has been moved into a separate file (channels.[ch]),
  and that all data members have been made private and are now only accessible
  through member functions. You may have to change any plugin code that accesses
  cChannel data accordingly.
- The new configuration file 'sources.conf' contains the various signal sources
  (satellites, cable and terrestrial) which are used in 'channels.conf' and
  'diseqc.conf' (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for adding some satellites to
  'sources.conf' and Oliver Endriss and Lauri Tischler for testing and debugging).
- The 'diseqc' parameter in the channel definitions has been redefined to hold the
  "source" of the given channel (which can be either a satellite, cable or terrestrial).
  For compatibility with channels.conf files from older versions, numeric values in
  this parameter will be tolerated, but they have no meaning. If you want to use
  DiSEqC you will need to replace these old values with the proper source identifiers
  defined in the new configuration file 'sources.conf'. See how this is done in the
  'channels.conf' file that comes with the VDR package.
- The new configuration file 'diseqc.conf' can be used to set up the individual
  diseqc configuration (see man vdr(5) for a description of the file format).
- The "Edit channel" menu has a new entry "Source:" in which the source of this
  channel can be selected (either a satellite, cable or terrestrial). The set of
  parameters at the end of this menu will change according to the type of source.
- The "Use DiSEqC" parameter in the "Setup/LNB" menu has been moved to the beginning
  of the list and disables the rest of the parameters when set to "yes", since these
  are now only meaningful if DiSEqC is _not_ used.
- Removed some unnecessary #includes from eit.c and changed cMenuRecordings::Del()
  to cMenuRecordings::Delete() to avoid warnings in gcc-3.2 (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz for pointing this out).
- Improved skipping channels that are (currently) not available (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt).
- Updated channels.conf.terr and channels.conf.cable (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Fixed a bug when pressing the "Blue" button in the main menu without having
  displayed it (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).

2002-10-13: Version 1.1.13

- Added cDevice::DeviceNumber() to get the number of a device, not counting any
  gaps that might be in the index count.
- Fixed fetching the current/next information to handle cases where the duration
  of an event is set wrongly and would last beyond the start time of the next
  event.
- Adapted type names to the new HEAD version of the driver (which the previous
  NEWSTRUCT branch has been merged into). Note that to use this driver version
  you still need to add NEWSTRUCT=1 to the make call when building VDR. You
  need a HEAD version of the LinuxDVB driver dated 2002-10-11 or later to compile
  VDR with NEWSTRUCT=1.
- Fixed radio channels in channels.conf.cable (thanks to Robert Schiele and Uwe
  Scheffler).
- Fixed switching the video format in the Setup/DVB menu (thanks to Uwe Scheffler
  for reporting this one).
- Reactivated full handling of second audio PID (even in 'Transfer Mode').
- Fixed a crash when closing down with remote control plugins (thanks to Oliver
  Endriss helping to debug this one).
- Commands in the file 'commands.conf' can now have a '?' at the end of their
  title, which will result in a confirmation prompt before executing the
  command.
- Changed a few leftover 'new char[...]' to MALLOC(char, ...).
- If a command executed from the "Commands" menu doesn't return any output, the
  OSD will now be closed automatically.
- The SVDRP command PUTE now triggers an immediate write of the 'epg.data' file
  (suggested by Gerhard Steiner).
- The new configuration file 'reccmds.conf' can be used to define commands that
  shall be executed from the "Recordings" menu; see MANUAL and 'man vdr(5)' for
  details (suggested by Gerhard Steiner).

2002-10-27: Version 1.1.14

- Fixed some faulty default parameter initializations (thanks to Robert Schiele).
- Added further satellites to 'sources.conf' (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner
  and Oliver Endriss).
- Updated Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti).
- Fixed a small glitch when switching channels (thanks to Dennis Noordsij for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed handling multiple 'CaCaps' entries in 'setup.conf'.
- Group separators in 'channels.conf' may now be given like ':@201 My Channels',
  where '@201' indicates the number to be given to the next channel. This can be
  used to create 'gaps' in the channel numbering (see 'man 5 vdr'). BE CAREFUL
  TO UPDATE YOUR 'timers.conf' ACCORDINGLY IF INSERTING THIS NEW FEATURE INTO YOUR
  'channels.conf' FILE!
- Timers now internally have a pointer to their channel (this is necessary to
  handle gaps in channel numbers, and in preparation for unique channel ids).
- Fixed slow reaction on SVDRP input (thanks to Guido Fiala for reporting this one).
- Added KI.KA to channels.conf.cable (thanks to Robert Schiele).
- Frequency values for cable and terrestrial channels in 'channels.conf' can
  now be given either in MHz, kHz or Hz. The actual value given will be multiplied
  by 1000 until it is larger than 1000000.
- Fixed skipping unavailable channels when zapping downwards.
- Fixed checking the Ca() status of a cDevice (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed switching audio tracks in 'Transfer Mode' on the primary DVB device
  (thanks to Steffen Barszus and Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one and
  helping to fix it).
- Fixed channel switching in case of an active 'Transfer Mode' on the primary
  device ('Transfer Mode' is now launched with priority '-1').
- Fixed a ternary expression in dvbspu.c.
- Fixed handling 'Transfer Mode' on single device systems when recording an
  encrypted channel (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed blocking replaying in case an encrypted channel is being recorded on
  the primary device.
- Now the name of the remote control is displayed when learning the keys.
- Fixed learning remote control keys in case there is more than one remote
  control (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).
- Implemented additional dedicated keys for "Play", "Pause", "Stop", "Record",
  "FastFwd", "FastRew", "Channel+" and "Channel-". If your remote control supports
  any of these keys you can delete your 'remote.conf' file and restart VDR to
  go through the key learning procedure again in order to assign these new keys.
  See MANUAL for more information.
  Authors of player plugins should update their ProcessKey() functions so that
  the new player keys have the same functionality as the "Up", "Down", "Left",
  "Right" and "Blue" keys, respectively. Note that the existing functionality
  of these keys should by all means be retained, since VDR (and any plugins)
  shall be fully usable with just the basic set of keys. These new keys are only
  for additional comfort in case the remote control in use supports them.
- Implemented new keys to directly access the VDR main menu functions "Schedule",
  "Channels", "Timers", "Recordings", "Setup" and "Commands". If your remote
  control provides keys you want to assign these functions to, you can delete
  your 'remote.cof' file and restart VDR to  go through the key learning procedure
  again in order to assign these new keys. See MANUAL for more information.
- The new configuration file 'keymacros.conf' can be used to assign macros to
  the color buttons in normal viewing mode, as well as to up to 9 user defined
  keys. See MANUAL and man vdr(5) for more information. The default 'keymacros.conf'
  implements the functionality of the "color button patch".
- Fixed a crash when learning the keys of several remote controls and pressing
  buttons of those that have already been learned (thanks to Oliver Endriss for
  reporting this one).

2002-11-03: Version 1.1.15

- Completely switched to the new CVS HEAD version of the linux-dvb driver.
  The NEWSTRUCT compile time switch is now obsolete. The required driver is now
  the CVS HEAD version dated 2002-11-01 or later.
- Adjusted the INSTALL file to the 1.1.x version.
- Only accepting key presses from the current remote control when learning (thanks to
  Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed the EPG scanner, which broke 'Transfer Mode' as soon as it kicked in
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling audio tracks in cDvbDevice.
- Updated channels.conf.terr (thanks to Uwe Scheffler).
- Fixed displaying the group separators in the channel display (thanks to Martin
  Hammerschmid for pointing out this one).
- The Makefile now includes the file Make.config (if present in the VDR source
  directory), which allows the user to overwrite several settings with individual
  values (suggested by Andreas Schultz). The VDR distribution archive does not
  contain this file in order to not overwrite a user defined file. There is a
  Make.config.template which contains the default values of the macros the user
  can overwrite.
- Since there have been changes to the 'newplugin' script authors of plugins
  may want to newly create their plugins' Makefiles with the new version of this
  script, and adapt them to their individual needs (make sure you don't overwrite
  your existing plugin directory - make a backup copy first!).
- Fixed reading EPG data via the SVDRP command PUTE (it changed the current
  service ID).
- Fixed closing all dup'ed file descriptors in cPipe.
- Implemented a plugin interface for additional audio processing (see PLUGINS.html
  under "Dolby Digital").
  The functionality of the '-a' command line option has been reactivated.
  Since the author doesn't have any Dolby Digital equipment this may or may not
  work as expected. There may still be some places where a call to cAudios::Clear()
  or cAudios::Mute() is necessary. Those with Dolby Digital equipment should please
  take a look at this and maybe send patches.
  Replaying Dolby Digital in ways other than through VDR's '-a' option will have to
  be implemented as plugins. Those who have written patches for VDR version 1.0.x
  should convert their work into the proper plugins for version 1.1.x.
  Note to authors of cPlayer derived plugins: please read the modified comments
  in device.h regarding the member functions cDevice::Clear(), cDevice::Mute() and
  cDevice::PlayAudio(). Derived classes must call these base class member functions
  to make sure all registered cAudio objects are properly handled. Also note that
  the return type of cDevice::PlayAudio() has been changed to 'void', since this
  function always has to accept the entire data block immediately and there is
  nothing that could be reasonably done in case an error occurs in one of the
  cAudio objects.
- Now checking the driver's DVB_API_VERSION in dvbdevice.h. Since VDR now requires
  a driver dated 2002-11-01 or later the MIN_DVB_DRIVER_VERSION_FOR_TIMESHIFT and
  DVB_DRIVER_VERSION stuff has been replaced with DO_REC_AND_PLAY_ON_PRIMARY_DEVICE,
  which can be used to disable simultaneous recording and replaying on the primary
  DVB device in case there are problems with this.

2002-11-10: Version 1.1.16

- Fixed saving the polarization parameter of channels that have a number in the
  'source' parameter (thanks to Peter Seyringer for reporting this one).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' (thanks to Andy Carter).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Achim Lange).
- First step towards a "unique channel ID". The channel ID is a human readable
  string, made up from several parameters of the channel's definition in the file
  'channels.conf' (see man vdr(5) for details).
  In order for the "unique channel ID" to work, all channel definitions now must
  be unique with respect to the combination of their Source, Frequency and SID
  parameters. You may have to fix your 'channels.conf' manually if there are error
  messages in the log file when loading it. BE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR
  'channels.conf' AND 'timers.conf' FILE BEFORE SWITCHING TO THIS VERSION, AND CHECK
  VERY CAREFULLY WHETHER YOUR TIMERS ARE STILL SET TO THE RIGHT CHANNELS!
  When reading an existing 'timers.conf', the channels will be identified as before
  by their numbers. As soon as this file is written back, the channel numbers will
  be replaced by the channel IDs. After that it is possible to manually edit the
  'channels.conf' file and rearrange the channels without breaking the timers.
  Note that you can still define new timers manually by using the channel number.
  VDR will correctly identify the 'channel' parameter in a timer definition and
  use it as a channel number or a channel ID, respectively. Also, the SVDRP commands
  that return timer definitions will list them with channel numbers in order to
  stay compatible with existing applications.
  The channel ID is also used in the 'epg.data' file to allow EPG information from
  different sources to be stored, which would previously have been mixed up in case
  they were using the same 'service ID'. Note that the contents of an existing
  'epg.data' file from a previous version will be silently ignored, since it doesn't
  contain the new channel IDs. When inserting EPG data into VDR via SVDRP you now also
  need to use the channel IDs.
  Currently the EPG data received from the DVB data stream only uses the 'Source'
  and 'Service ID' part of the channel ID. This makes it work for channels with
  the same service IDs on different sources (like satellites, cable or terrestrial).
  However, it doesn't work yet if the service IDs are not unique within a specific
  source. This will be fixed later.
- Added missing SID parameters to 'channels.conf'. Some channels have been removed
  since they are apparently no longer broadcasted.
- Removed dropping EPG events from "other" streams that have a duration of 86400
  seconds or more (was introduced in version 1.1.10). This has become obsolete by
  the modification in version 1.1.13, which fixed fetching the current/next information
  to handle cases where the duration of an event is set wrongly and would last beyond
  the start time of the next event. Besides, the change in 1.1.10 broke handling EPG
  data for NVOD channels.
- Fixed a compiler warning regarding cMenuChannels::Del() and MenuTimers::Del() hiding
  the base class virtual functions.

2002-11-24: Version 1.1.17

- Added new entries to 'ca.conf'.
- Fixed closing unused PID handles (thanks to Stefan Schluenss for reporting this
  one).
- Added more examples to 'diseqc.conf' (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed disabling multiple recordings on a single DVB card (comment out the definition
  of the macros DO_REC_AND_PLAY_ON_PRIMARY_DEVICE and DO_MULTIPLE_RECORDINGS in
  dvbdevice.c).
- Plugins can now have their very own OSD setup in the object they return from
  a call to cPlugin::MainMenuAction(). In order to implement this, the return type
  of cPlugin::MainMenuAction() had to be changed from (cOsdMenu *) to (cOsdObject *).
  So in case you are compiling an existing plugin with this version of VDR and you
  get an error message, simply change cOsdMenu to cOsdObject in the plugin's source
  for the MainMenuAction() function.
  Plugin authors who have so far (ab)used the cControl mechanism to implement their
  own raw OSD should take a look at the new demo plugin 'osddemo'. It implements
  a very primitive game that shows how a plugin can have its own raw OSD. Especially
  look into cLineGame and see how it implements the Show() function. See also
  the chapter on "User interaction" in PLUGINS.html.
- Added three new fields to the lines in 'channels.conf': NID, TID and RID. NID and
  TID are the Network and Transport Stream IDs, respectively. RID is an additional ID
  that can be used to tell apart channels that would otherwise be indistinguishable.
  This is typically the case with radio channels, which may have the same NID, TID
  and SID, but different "radio IDs". This new field is therefore called RID ("radio
  ID"). Currently NID and TID are not yet used by VDR and should always be 0. The
  RID is actually used when building the "unique channel ID", so if you have channels
  in your 'channels.conf' file that cause error messages when loading, you can set
  the RIDs of these channels to different values.
  When reading an old 'channels.conf' these new fields will be automatically
  initialized to 0 and once the file is written back to disk they will be appended
  to the channel definitions.
  Thanks to Régis Bossut for pointing out that with some providers the channels can
  only be distinguished through the RID.
- The "unique channel ID" now contains an optional 5th part (the RID). See man vdr(5).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' and made some channels unique using the new RID
  (thanks to Andreas Kool for pointing out the problems).
- Made some channels unique in 'channels.conf.terr' using the new RID.
- Extended the '-l' option to allow logging to LOG_LOCALn (n=0..7) by writing, for
  instance, '-l 3.7' (suggested by Jürgen Schmidt).
- Now deleting stale lock files if they have a time stamp that is outside the window
  'now +/- LOCKFILESTALETIME'. This improves things in cases where the system time
  makes far jumps, so that a lock file might end up with a time stamp that lies
  in the distant future (thanks to Oliver Endriss).

2002-12-01: Version 1.1.18

- Fixed missing initialization of 'number' in cChannel (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid
  for reporting this one).
- Fixed a misplaced ')' in the fix about the stale lock files (thanks again to
  Oliver Endriss for pointing this out - it was my fault).
- Group delimiters in the 'channels.conf' file that have no text (like a simple ":"
  or ":@201") no longer show up in the Channels menu (suggested by Guy Roussin).
- Added "Tele 5" to 'channels.conf' (thanks to Georg Hitsch).
- Changed the source directory name for plugins from 'SRC' to 'src' (suggested by
  Clemens Kirchgatterer).
- Removed transponders 10788, 11739 and 12266 from 'channels.conf' (apparently they
  are no longer active).
- Deactivated some templates in tools.h in case some plugin needs to use the STL
  (suggested by Gerald Berwolf).
- Timers now accept channel IDs even if the 'source' is 0 (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt
  for reporting this one).
- Now taking an active SVDRP connection into account when doing shutdown or
  housekeeping (suggested by Emil Naepflein).
- Macros in 'keymacros.conf' can now use "@plugin" to directly access the main menu
  function of a given plugin (see man vdr(5) for details).
- The new plugin 'sky' can be used to integrate a Sky Digibox into the VDR system,
  using a Kfir MPEG2 encoder card (see PLUGINS/src/sky/README for details).

2002-12-08: Version 1.1.19

- The character '|' in description texts of EPG records is now interpreted as a
  newline character (suggested by Gerhard Steiner).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Andreas Kool).
- Improved handling of repeated remote keys.
- The RCU now only sets the channel number display when there are no incoming remote
  control keys, which improves reaction on repeated keys.
- The actual tuning is now done in a separate thread, which makes zapping through the
  channels a lot faster and no longer gets stuck on channels that don't broadcast.
  This also makes "Motor-DiSEqC" work (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for his help
  in testing this). Since switching channels now no longer explicitly waits for a
  channel lock in the foreground thread, the "panic level" mechanism is no longer
  used (maybe we don't need it any more, anyway).
- The keyboard is now by default always active to control VDR. The 'make' option
  REMOTE=KBD is therefore obsolete. When compiling VDR with REMOTE=RCU or REMOTE=LIRC,
  the keyboard can thus now be active together with the remote control. If you want
  to build VDR _without_ keyboard support you can set NO_KBD=1 in the 'make' call.
  Since the keyboard codes are now different from the ones used previously (which
  were mapped by the 'ncurses' library) you will need to go through the "Learning
  keys" procedure again. To do so, either delete the file /video/remote.conf or
  remove the KBD.* entries from it before starting this version of VDR.
  (Thanks to Thomas Sailer for pointing out how to set the terminal parameters to
  read from the keyboard).
- The 'ncurses' library is now only necessary when compiling VDR with DEBUG_OSD=1.

2002-12-15: Version 1.1.20

- Now checking if there is a connection to the keyboard (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti)
  and only creating the KBD remote control if VDR is running in the foreground.
- Fixed taking an active SVDRP connection into account when doing shutdown (thanks
  to Gregoire Favre for reporting this one).
- Changed setting of CXX and CXXFLAGS variables in Makefile, so that an externally
  defined value will be taken if present (suggested by Robert Schiele).
  Plugin authors should please change the lines

  CXX      = g++
  CXXFLAGS = -O2 -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual

  in their Makefile to

  CXX      ?= g++
  CXXFLAGS ?= -O2 -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual

- Fixed recording overlapping timers on the same channel in case
  DO_REC_AND_PLAY_ON_PRIMARY_DEVICE and/or DO_MULTIPLE_RECORDINGS is not defined
  (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti).
- No longer stopping/restarting the DMX when switching audio channels (thanks to
  Sven Goethel).
- Fixed high CPU load in 'Transfer Mode' (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- If a PC keyboard is used as remote control, the string entry fields in the
  menus now accept character input directly (however, this works only for keys that
  are not otherwise defined as remote control keys). Also, plugins can switch the
  cKbdRemote class into "raw mode", where all keyboard input will be made available
  through the new 'kKbd' key code and none of it will be processed as normal remote
  control functions (thanks to Jan Rieger for suggestions and testing).
- Fixed deleting characters in string entry fields in 'insert' mode.
- Now using "Doxygen" to generate source documentation (thanks to Walter Stroebel
  for providing an initial 'Doxyfile' configuration and adjusting some comments).
  See INSTALL for information how to do this. Some function descriptions have
  already been adapted to Doxygen, more will follow.

2003-01-10: Version 1.1.21

- Fixed the 'channels.conf' entries for "Studio Universal" and "Disney Channel".
- Fixed handling channels in the "Channels" menu in case there are ':@nnn' group
  separators without names (thanks to Guy Roussin for reporting this one).
- The SVDRP command CHAN now also accepts channel IDs.
- Increased the timeout until an index file is considerd no longer to be written
  (sometimes in time shift with heavy system load the index file was closed too
  early by the replay thread).
- Implemented "Link Layer" based CAM support, which hopefully will solve the
  problems with CAMs we had in the past. To use this you need the driver version
  2002-01-08 or higher (with the new firmware supporting the "Link Layer" protocol).
- Added an EPG bugfix that moves the Subtitle data to the Extended Description in
  case the latter is empty and the Subtitle exceeds some useful length.
- Since several channels put very long strings into the Subtitle part of their
  EPG data, that string is now limited in length when used in a recording's
  file name.

2003-01-26: Version 1.1.22

- Added 'Hrvatska radiotelevizija' and 'RTV Slovenija' to ca.conf (thanks to
  Paul Gohn).
- Implemented actual user input for CAM enquiry menus.
- Since disk file systems apparently don't honor the O_NONBLOCK flag to read from
  a file in non-blocking mode the cDvbPlayer now uses a non blocking file reader
  class to make sure replay remains smooth even under heavy system load.
- Increased the maximum possible packet size in remux.c to avoid corrupted streams
  with broadcasters that send extremely large PES packets (thanks to Teemu Rantanen).
- Added TS error checking to remux.c (thanks to Teemu Rantanen).
- Modified cRingBufferLinear to avoid excessive memmove() calls in 'Transfer Mode'
  and during recordings, which dramatically reduces CPU load. Thanks to Teemu
  Rantanen for pinpointing the problem with the excessive memmove() calls.
- Updated 'channels.conf' (thanks to Achim Lange).
- Added/improved Swedish language texts (thanks to Jan Ekholm).
- Fixed the description of the "Scroll pages" OSD setup parameter ('yes' and 'no'
  were mixed up).
- Fixed handling the LOG_LOCALn parameters in the -l option (thanks to Dimitrios
  Dimitrakos).
- Changed EIT processing to always read a full section.
- Fixed handling user defined CFLAGS in libdtv/libvdr/Makefile (thanks to Clemens
  Kirchgatterer and Robert Schiele).
- Fixed skipping unavailable channels in the EPG scanner.

2003-02-02: Version 1.1.23

- Fixed a new/delete malloc/free mismatch in ringbuffer.c (thanks to Stefan
  Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Improved CAM handling.

2003-02-09: Version 1.1.24

- Improved CAM handling (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for a great deal of help
  in debugging this). It is now possible to insert the CAM in any of the two slots,
  to insert and remove it while VDR is running and even to have two CAMs inserted.
- Turning SI filtering off and on when switching channels.
- Timers are now processed even if an OSD menu is open (except for menus that
  explicitly handle timers).

2003-02-16: Version 1.1.25

- Fixed high CPU load during replay (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for pointing out this
  one).
- Fixed margin handling in cRingBufferLinear.
- Now polling the output device in 'Transfer Mode' and retrying to put packets
  into the ring buffer.
- Resetting the CAM slot in case communication breaks down.
- Improved keyboard detection (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' (thanks to Andy Carter).
- Fixed broken support for raw OSDs of plugins (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for
  reporting this one).
- Broken CAM connections are now restored automatically.

2003-03-19: Version 1.1.26

- Removed signal handling and usleep(5000) from cDvbOsd::Cmd() (apparently this
  is no longer necessary with DVB driver 1.0.0pre2 or later).
- If the primary device (as defined in setup.conf) doesn't have an MPEG decoder
  (and thus can't be used as a primary device) VDR now scans all devices at
  startup and uses the first one (if any) that actually has an MPEG decoder.
  That way this will also work automatically if the primary device is implemented
  by a plugin.
- Fixed a possible deadlock when using the "Blue" button in the "Schedules" menu
  to switch to an other channel (thanks to Torsten Herz).
- Fixed the EPG bugfix code number for the MAX_USEFUL_SUBTITLE_LENGTH fix (thanks to
  Torsten Herz for reporting this one).
- Modified the EPG scanner to avoid CPU load peaks (thanks to Steffen Becker for
  reporting this one).
- Fixed support for Viaccess CAMs (thanks to Axel Gruber for helping to debug this).

2003-04-13: Version 1.1.27

- The CAM is now accessed only if the current channel actually has a non-zero Ca
  value, and CAM access is completely suppressed during replay, which avoids
  problems in case the CAM is attached to the primary DVB device.
- The "Left" and "Right" buttons now set the cursor to the first or last list item
  even if the list consist only of a single page, like, for instance, the Main menu
  (thanks to Oliver Endriss).
- Made the log message "OSD window width must be a multiple of 4..." a debug message
  instead of an error message, so it can be avoided by using a log level less than 3.
- Updated Greek language texts (thanks to Dimitrios Dimitrakos).
- Fixed faulty behaviour of the "Mute" key in case the channel display is visible
  (thanks to Florian Bartels for reporting this one and Sascha Volkenandt for
  helping to fix it).
- Modified LOF handling to allow for C-band reception (thanks to Malcolm Caldwell).
- Added some missing cAudio handling calls (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Replaced the 'for' loops in StripAudioPackets() with memset() calls (thanks to
  Werner Fink).
- Further increased the timeout until an index file is considerd no longer to be
  written.
- Fixed a crash in case the index file can't be accessed any more during replay
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).
- Fixed displaying messages in the status line in case they exceed the OSD width
  (thanks to Gerhard Steiner for reporting this one).
- Avoiding high CPU load in case the connection to LIRC gets lost (thanks to
  Ludwig Nussel).
- Fixed handling repeat function with LIRC (thanks to Ludwig Nussel).
- Fixed handling min/max borders when entering integer values (thanks to Andy
  Grobb for reporting this one).
- Implemented a "resume ID" which allows several users to each have their own
  resume.vdr files (thanks to Martin Hammerschmid). This parameter can be set in
  the "Setup/Replay" menu (see MANUAL for details).
- Now using 'libdtv' version 0.0.5 (thanks to Rolf Hakenes for the new version
  and Stefan Huelswitt for adapting VDR to it).
- If no device with an MPEG decoder can be found at startup, the first device
  is now used as primary device (just to have some device).
- Adjusted some Premiere channels in 'channels.conf' (thanks to Thomas Koch).
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Stefan Hußfeldt).
- The 'epg.data' file is now read after all plugins have been started (thanks
  to Sascha Volkenandt).
- The LIRC remote control no longer tries to learn keys if it can't connect to
  the LIRC daemon (thanks to Ludwig Nussel for reporting this one). The same
  applies to the RCU remote control in case of errors during startup.
- Fixed handling of Ca parameters with values <= MAXDEVICES, which don't indicate
  an actual encrypted channel (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt for reporting this one).

2003-04-21: Version 1.1.28

- Using masks in EIT filtering to reduce the number of filters (thanks to Andreas
  Schultz).
- Fixed handling Ca descriptors (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Now only those Ca descriptors are sent to a CAM that are actually understood
  by that CAM.
- Re-enabled CAM communication during replay and on non-Ca channels. This requires
  a DVB driver with firmware version 2613 or later.
- It is now possible to do simultaneous recording and replay with a single DVB
  card, even with encrypted channels. This requires the use of the Link Layer
  firmware, version 2613 or higher; the -icam firmware is still limited to live
  encrypted channels only. Finally we have time shift for encrypted channels on
  single card systems!
- Enhanced detection of pending user I/O from CAMs to avoid sluggish reaction
  to remote control keypresses.
- Implemented "pause live video". You can now press "Menu/Yellow" or "Pause" on
  your remote control while watching live video to start an instant recording
  of the current programme and immediately start replaying that recording.

2003-04-27: Version 1.1.29

- Fixed detecting broken connection to the LIRC daemon (thanks to Ludwig Nussel).
- Now sending CA descriptors to the CAM in the same sequence as they were originally
  received (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- The PCR PID can now be set separately from the video PID. The syntax in the
  'channels.conf' file is, for example, ...:164+17:..., where 164 is the video PID
  and 17 is the PCR PID. The separator is a '+' sign, not a comma or semicolon as
  with the audio PIDs, because this is not an alternate PID, but rather an
  additional, necessary PID. In order to use this feature you need a driver version
  dated 2003-04-27 or higher (setting the PCR PID didn't work in earlier versions).
- Fixed deleting the last recording in the "Recordings" menu, which started pausing
  live video (thanks to Christoph Friederich for reporting this one).
- Now setting the "broken link" flag for GOPs at the beginning of a new video
  sequence, which avoids artefacts when cutting (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Removed the Mute() call from cDvbDevice::StillPicture() (suggested by Andreas
  Schultz).
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Berlin (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Extended logging info when starting/stopping timers to show the channel number,
  start/stop time and the file name (suggested by Manuel Hartl).
- Added a note regarding non-VDR files in the /videoX directories to INSTALL
  (suggested by Benjamin Harling).
- Skipping keys that come in too fast from LIRC (thanks to Christian Jacobsen).
- Avoiding short display of the main menu if a plugin displays its own OSD and
  is started through a user defined key macro (thanks to Andreas Mair for reporting
  this one).
- Reduced the time to wait for EPG data when starting a recording to 3 seconds.
- The new SVDRP command STAT can be used to request information about the disk
  usage (thanks to Thomas Koch).
- Fixed faulty calculation of section length in eit.c (thanks to Teemu Rantanen).

2003-05-04: Version 1.1.30

- Fixed minimum lifespan of deleted recordings (thanks to Jaakko Hyvätti).
- Updated French OSD texts (thanks to Olivier Jacques).
- Fixed paging through lists with repeated Left/Right keys.
- Fixed setting the PCR-PID in case it is equal to one of the other PIDs (thanks
  to Oliver Endriss for reporting this one).
- Fixed double call to MainMenuAction() of a plugin if invoked via a hotkey (thanks
  to Kai Moeller for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling dedicated keys.
- Now turning off live PIDs when replaying. This avoids short spikes from other
  channels when switching between Transfer Mode channels, and also lets an ongoing
  replay continue even if a recording is started on the primary device.
- The RCU channel display no longer changes when a recording on a different
  channel starts on the primary device.
- Restoring the current channel in case a recording has switched the transponder.
  If all devices are busy and none of them can provide the current channel, the
  message "Channel not available!" will be displayed.
- Removed the (no longer necessary) 'panic' stuff from cThread.
- Added cStatus::OsdItem() to provide the entire list of menu items to a plugin
  (thanks to Carsten Siebholz).
- The red ("Record") and yellow ("Pause") button in the "Main" menu are no longer
  available when replaying.

2003-05-11: Version 1.1.31

- Introduced the new function cPlugin::Initialize(), in order to be able to separate
  the startup of a plugin into an "early" (Initialize()) and "late" (Start()) phase
  (suggested by Andreas Schultz). Plugin authors should please read the section
  about "Getting started" in PLUGINS.html and adapt their code if applicable.
- Implemented the CableDeliverySystemDescriptor and TerrestrialDeliverySystemDescriptor
  in libdtv (thanks to Sven Grothklags and Andreas Schultz).
- Fixed keeping live video active in case the primary device doesn't have an MPEG
  decoder (thanks to Wolfgang Goeller for reporting this one).
- Implemented cDevice::ActualDevice(), which returns the actual receiving device in
  case of 'Transfer Mode', or the primary device otherwise. This may be useful for
  plugins that want to attach a cReceiver to the device where the current live video
  is actually coming from.
- Added VDRVERSNUM to config.h, which can be used by the preprocessor to check the
  actual VDR version (suggested by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Removed the WaitForPut/WaitForGet stuff from cRingBuffer, since it appears to
  no longer be necessary due to the implementation of cNonBlockingFileReader in
  dvbplayer.c. Also, the long timeout in WaitForPut caused problems with cReceivers
  that use a ring buffer and didn't immediately return from their Receive() function
  if the buffer runs full (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling EPG data where the "extended event descriptor" comes before the
  "short event" or a "time shifted event" (thanks to Jonan Santiago).
- Disabled the "Received stuffing section in EIT" log message.
- Updated 'channels.conf.terr' for Berlin (thanks to Juri Haberland).
- Avoiding short display of the "Main" menu when pressing the "Recordings" button
  or the "Back" button during replay.
- Further increased the timeout until an index file is considerd no longer to be
  written.
- Implemented separate PausePriority and PauseLifetime parameters for the recordings
  created when pausing live video (suggested by Alfred Zastrow).
- Changed C++ style comments in libdtv into C style to avoid warnings in gcc 3.x
  (thanks to Andreas Schultz).

2003-05-18: Version 1.1.32

- Removed a faulty parameter initialization in menu.c (thanks to Lauri Tischler for
  reporting this one).
- Re-implemented the WaitForPut/WaitForGet stuff in cRingBuffer, since some plugins
  actually need this. By default the buffer does not wait; if a plugin needs the
  waiting functionality it can call the new SetTimeouts() function.
- Moved the call to cPlugin::Start() further up in vdr.c, to make sure it gets
  called before trying to learn the keys (problem reported by Oliver Endriss).
- No longer starting the editing process if no marks have been set (thanks to
  Matthias Raus for reporting this one).
- Added Catalanian language texts (thanks to Marc Rovira Vall and Ramon Roca).
  Plugin authors may want to add the new entries to their I18N texts and contact
  the translators to have their texts translated. Note that there are now 16
  different OSD languages, so please make sure you have 16 versions for each of
  your texts.
- Moved the detection of a broken video data stream from the cDevice into the
  cRecorder to avoid problems with cReceivers that want to receive from PIDs
  that are currently not transmitting (thanks to Marcel Wiesweg for reporting
  this one).
- Fixed setting the locking pid after a timed wait (thanks to Andreas Schultz).
- Avoiding spurious section filter settings after a channel switch.
- Updated 'channels.conf.cable' (thanks to Stefan Hußfeldt).
- Fixed reading 'epg.data' for channels with non-zero RID (thanks to Oliver
  Endriss for reporting this one).
- Fixed EPG bugfix statistics to avoid log entires for undefined channels (thanks
  to Lars Bläser for reporting this one).
- No longer waiting inside cIndexFile::CatchUp() to avoid shortly blocking replay
  at the end of a recording.

2003-05-25: Version 1.1.33

- Modified handling of audio packets in cDvbPlayer for better sync with external
  AC3 replay (thanks to Werner Fink).
- Fixed a memory leak in cNonBlockingFileReader (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Completed the French OSD texts (thanks to Gregoire Favre).
- Completed the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Niko Tarnanen and Rolf Ahrenberg).
- Fixed I/O handling in case an explicit controlling terminal is given (thanks
  to Oliver Endriss).
- Fixed resume file handling in case the resume.vdr file can't be written
  (thanks to Gerhard Steiner).
- Fixed cutting a recording if there is only a single editing mark (thanks to
  Ralf Klueber for reporting this one).
- Fixed volume display in case a plugin has its own OSD open (thanks to Marcel
  Wiesweg).
- Fixed channel switching in the EPG scanner on single device systems.
- Completed the Swedish OSD texts (thanks to Tomas Prybil).
- Now switching to the channel used by the most recently started timer in case
  the original current channel becomes unavailable due to a recording on a
  different transponder. If this fails, a channel up/down switch is attempted as
  a fallback solution (thanks to Lauri Tischler for reporting this one, and to
  Hermann Gausterer for suggesting to switch to the recording channel).
- Fixed cReplayControl::Show() to avoid a compiler warning in g++ 3.2.3 (thanks
  to Jan Ekholm for reporting this one).
- Completed the Slovenian OSD texts (thanks to Matjaz Thaler).
- Changed the DEFAULTPRIORITY in device.c to -1, so that the primary device
  will be used for FTA recordings in case the CAM is connected to a non-primary
  device (thanks to Reinhard Walter Buchner for reporting this one).
- The cCiHandler now closes its file handle when it gets destroyed.
- Checking for duplicate recordings with the same file name and disabling the
  second timer (thanks to Peter Bieringer for reporting this one).
- Fixed handling newly created timers in case they are not confirmed with "Ok"
  (thanks to Gerhard Steiner for reporting this one).
- It is now possible to directly delete a timer that is currently recording
  (thanks to Alexander Damhuis for reporting this one).

2003-05-30: Version 1.2.0pre1

- Some corrections to the French OSD texts (thanks to Olivier Jacques).

  Ahrenberg).
- Completed the Italian OSD texts (thanks to Antonio Ospite).
- Fixed breaking off replay in case the user hits "Play" or "Pause" too soon after
  going into "Pause live video" mode (thanks to Karim Afifi for reporting ths one).
- Some corrections to the Catalanian OSD texts (thanks to Jordi Vilà).
- Single event timers are now deleted if the recording they are doing is
  deleted before the timer ends.
- Fixed an uninitialized variable in cDisplayChannel (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).
- Fixed a possible access of invalid file handles in cSIProcessor::Action()
  (thanks to Stefan Huelswitt).

2003-06-09: Version 1.2.1

- Fixed OSD access in case none of the devices provides one (thanks to Axel
  Gruber for reporting this one).
- Fixed editing channels ('timers.conf' was not written after a channel has
  been modified, which could result in errors upon the next start of VDR).
- Fixed a crash when cancelling a newly created timer (thanks to Thomas Schmidt
  for reporting this one).
- Completed Hungarian language texts (thanks to Istvan Koenigsberger and Guido
  Josten).
- Fixed device handling in the CICAM menu in case a VDR instance was started
  with a specific device using the -D option (thanks to Gerald Raaf for reporting
  ths one).
- Initializing the current channel to '1' to avoid a crash in creating a new
  timer in case there is no device in the system that can actually receive any
  channel (thanks to Malcolm Caldwell for reporting this one).
- Some corrections to the Finnish OSD texts (thanks to Niko Tarnanen and Rolf
  Ahrenberg).

2003-08-03: Version 1.2.2

- Fixed a bug in channel switching after Left/Right has been pressed (thanks to
  Michael Walle for reporting this one).
- Improved channel switching in case of numerical input by switching as soon as
  the channel is unique (suggested by Jaakko Hyvätti).
- Fixed creating a new channel in the "Channels" menu in case the 'channels.conf'
  contains ':@nnn' lines with no text (thanks to Guy Roussin for reporting this
  one).
- Changed the behaviour of the '0' key in normal viewing mode so that a channel
  only qualifies as "previous" if it has been selected for at least 3 seconds
  (suggested by Thomas Keil).
- Now clearing the channel info display when entering numeric keys to switch
  channels (suggested by Guy Roussin).
- Added missing I18N entry for "Ppid" (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg).

  Aafløy).
- Fixed selecting the device, because sometimes an FTA recording terminated a
  CA recording (thanks to Emil Naepflein).

  with VFAT=1 (thanks to Ernst Fürst for reporting this one).
- Now the program uses the values of VIDEODIR and PLUGINDIR defined in Makefile
  or Makefile.config as defaults (thanks to Steffen Barszus).
- Added the usual menu timeout to the CAM menus.
