* Selecting a Channel

  There are three ways to select a channel:

  1. With no On Screen Menu displayed press the "Up" or "Down" key to switch
     to the next higher or lower channel.
  2. Press the "Menu" button to bring up the On Screen Menu, select "Channels"
     and browse through the list with the "Up" and "Down" key; to switch to the
     selected channel press "Ok".
  2. Directly type in the channel number with the numeric keys ('0'..'9');
     if no key is pressed for about half a second, the digits collected so
     far will define the channel number.

  After switching to a different channel the channel number and name, as well
  as the current time are displayed at the top of the screen. This line
  automatically goes away after about two seconds, or if any key is pressed.
  To bring up the channel display without switching channels you can press
  the "Ok" button.

* Instant Recording

  You can start recording the current channel by pressing the "Record"
  button. This will create a timer event named "instant" that start
  at the current time and records for two hours.
  If you want to modify the recording time you need to edit the timer.
  Stop instant recording by disabling or deleting the timer.

* Replaying a Recording

  All recordings are listed in the "Recordings" menu. Browse through the
  list with the "Up" and "Down" button and press "Ok" (or the "Red" button)
  to start playback.

* Replay Control

  - "Begin"   Positions to beginning of the recording and starts playback
              from there.
  - "Pause"   Halts playback at the current frame. Press again to continue
              playback.
  - "Stop"    Stops playback and stores the current position, so that
              playback can be resumed later at that point.
  - "Search"  Runs playback forward or backward at a higher speed. Press
              again to resume normal speed.
  - "Skip"    Skips about 60 seconds forward or backward.
